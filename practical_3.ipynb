Retirement beckons for McCoy, champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997, and he will stop riding immediately if his mount Shutthefrontdoor wins the £1million Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday. AP McCoy celebrates Grand National victory on Don’t Push It in 2010 . Shutthefrontdoor, trained by Jonjo O’Neill, will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once-a-year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don’t Push It. In a perfect world, the National will finish with McCoy standing high in his irons celebrating but he, more than anyone, knows nothing is guaranteed in a sport as unpredictable as jump racing. It won’t, however, stop the 40-year-old hoping his script has a glorious finale. ‘I’m a dreamer,’ said McCoy, who announced his plans to retire in February. ‘I’m a believer – I always have been. McCoy seeks to end record-breaking career with victory on Shutthefrontdoor in the Grand National . 'If everyone has gone to bed thinking the dream will happen, I can promise you nobody has been dreaming more than me. In some ways, I regret making the announcement to retire when I did. I’ve thought to myself I should have just kept quiet. But in other ways I think it has been good. ‘If it’s created publicity for racing and helped get interest in the sport, so much the better. ‘Racing has been good to me and if this has been me giving something back, great. If people are putting money on Shutthefrontdoor in the hope I win for the fairytale, let me assure them nobody will be wanting me to win more than I do. People talk about me having ridden more winners than anyone else but I’ve also ridden more losers than anyone else. A thank you message board to retiring jockey McCoy on display at Aintree . ‘I’ve had 19 goes at this race and won once, so that gives you an idea of what it is going to be like.’ The last time a horse carried such goodwill was when Frankel, trained by the late Sir Henry Cecil, won the Champions Stakes at Ascot in October 2012. Mention of that brought a wry smile from McCoy. ‘I wish it was as straightforward as running around a couple of bends at Ascot!’ he said. ‘I’ve got 30 fences and 38 other horses in my way! But, listen, I’m a positive person and that is never going to change. Let’s hope the dream can happen.’ McCoy has vowed to end his career immediately should he land the £1million race for a second time .\n","**Gold label summary**: AP McCoy will retire immediately if he wins the Grand National .

His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'\n","**Gold label summary**: Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

When award-winning BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant walked into a clinic one afternoon to have a yellow fever vaccine, he was warned the possible side-effects could be dizzy spells and a headache. Yet within 24 hours of having the jab, in April 2011, Malcolm had been reduced to a sweating, shivering wreck, gripped by a fever so strong it took two weeks and a spell in hospital before his temperature was brought down. Then the psychosis began. A shooting star, glimpsed from the balcony of his home, convinced Malcolm - who had no previous history of mental illness - that he was a modern-day Messiah. 'I went completely bonkers,' he says today. 'The vaccine fried my brain.' Malcolm, 59, who had the jab in preparation for an assignment in the Ivory Coast, believed his Kindle could fly, that dead friends were contacting him and that he could stop traffic just by thinking about it. He spent the next two years in and out of mental institutions, unable to work - and even attempted suicide. Fortunately, he has since made a full recovery. But Malcolm believes the yellow fever vaccine - available in High Street vaccination clinics, GP surgeries and even Boots - could have dangerous side-effects that affect more people than previously thought. Since its invention in 1951, more than 540 million doses of the vaccine have been given. Anyone travelling to parts of Africa or South America is advised to have it. Yellow fever is a serious viral infection spread by mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite and nausea. While many people recover after five or six days, 15 per cent enter a second, toxic phase, with recurring fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice due to liver damage. They may also start vomiting blood. This toxic phase is fatal in about 20 per cent of cases. Clearly a dangerous illness, there is no doubt vaccination can be life-saving. But Malcolm and others who say they have been adversely affected by the jab want the manufacturer to investigate. Malcolm, who for many years was the Beeb's man in Greece, had the jab in a clinic in Athens, where his family was living. Next morning, his new wife Trine, found him downstairs, shivering and sweating, his face beetroot red. 'I was beside myself with worry,' says Trine, 55, an author and journalist. 'It wasn't just the fever but the change in character. He became irrational, then emotional - crying.' When his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days, Trine took Malcolm to hospital. The doctors, who also discovered through blood tests that Malcolm had suffered recent liver damage, told him they believed he'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side-effects . They managed to lower his temperature. But his mental problems were only just beginning. Formerly agnostic, Malcolm became convinced he was Jesus, and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication. It was a harrowing time for Trine. 'One day I visited him in hospital and he stripped off his clothes and asked me to turn the sheet into a nappy and put it on him so everyone could see he was Jesus,' she says. 'Doctors had told me not to upset him, just to do what he asked, so I did it. It was heartbreaking.' After three weeks, Malcolm was discharged in May 2011, and seemed to be recovering, so went back to work. But within weeks he deteriorated again. Malcolm developed full-blown psychosis, and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the UK, Greece, and eventually with money running out, in Trine's native Copenhagen. On one occasion he attempted to take his own life. Happily, Malcolm was well enough to be discharged from hospital in July 2012 and has since made a full recovery. He is now pursuing the manufacturers of the vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, to admit liability for what happened to him. As Trine explains: 'Every doctor we dealt with said they thought he'd suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Since May 2011 I have been back to Sanofi Pasteur many times, but they are refusing to do anything or even meet us.' Malcolm is not the only person who believes they have had an adverse reaction to the drug. He is in touch with 12 others who believe they, too, have suffered grave side-effects. The NHS says that up to three in ten people who are immunised with the yellow fever vaccine suffer a mild headache, muscle aches, mild fever or soreness at the injection site - and that these symptoms occur because your immune system is trying to fight the small dose of yellow fever you have been injected with. These symptoms may last for up to 14 days after the injection. It's thought that far fewer people, four in a million, suffer more serious psychotic or neurological reactions, mainly unconnected to the symptoms of yellow fever itself. One of those is former Royal Naval Commander Graham Beard, who is convinced the jab, which he had in July 1999, ruined his health. He still suffers bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches (posed by model) A fortnight after being given the injection, Graham, now 56, experienced terrible pains down his left side. He spent three weeks in Watford General Hospital and another three in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queens Square, London. 'No diagnosis was made, except that I had suffered a major neurological illness,' says Graham, a father-of-two from Wales. After three months at home convalescing, Graham - who had also been unable to move - finally got movement back in his limbs and the pain disappeared. But then began a series of debilitating attacks which continue to this day. 'While now controlled by epilepsy medication, I still suffer bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches, which occur sometimes daily or with gaps of several days or weeks,' he says. 'The most I have ever had is 19 in a single day. The stress and exhaustion from these attacks essentially stopped my career. I managed to hang on for ten years, but by 2010, after 32 years in the Navy, I realised I wasn't being fair on the team. 'Having struggled to accommodate the condition, while taking a staggering succession of medications and having constant tests, it finally beat me and I had to walk away from the career I loved.' Graham always mentioned to specialists that his symptoms seemed to have begun after he had the yellow fever jab and, consequently, he has been advised by medical professionals it's likely that a vaccine caused the problem. But it was only after hearing about other cases such as Malcolm's that he decided to speak out. 'Surely the company that makes the vaccine has a moral duty to review it to see if it should be modified or replaced,' says Graham. As long ago as 2005, Dr Thomas Monath, a former Harvard public health professor and world expert on yellow fever, confirmed that the vaccine can cause 'really severe and significant adverse events'. He told Good Health: 'While we should not overlook the 60 years of wide use of yellow fever vaccine, with a remarkable record of safety and effective prevention of this terrible disease, rare and unusual adverse events temporally associated with vaccination may occur. Some of these, such as the neuropsychiatric syndromes described in Mr Brabant's case, may not be acknowledged as causally related in the official literature.' The manufacturer, however, does not believe it needs to reassess the vaccine. In 2013 Dr Ronald Neeleman, head of vaccination innovation at Sanofi Pasteur, admitted to a conference that the vaccine hadn't been reviewed in many years, saying it serves 'a small market, with very low returns, and there is not really an incentive to redevelop'. A spokesman told Good Health that the company takes reports of adverse events 'very seriously' and ensures they are investigated promptly, but 'after carefully examining all the medical information that has been disclosed to us up to April 2013, we have been unable to establish any evidence for a causal relationship between the administration of the yellow fever vaccine Stamaril and Mr Brabant's reported medical condition. 'The current state of scientific knowledge does not support that these reported symptoms could be biologically plausibly linked to the natural history of the disease, nor the mode of action of the vaccine. 'Similarly, the observation of an event after vaccination does not automatically mean that vaccination has caused this event.' Malcolm, who has written a book, Malcolm Is A Little Unwell, won't be satisfied until the experiences of people like him are acknowledged in official literature about the vaccine and he has been offered compensation. 'The vaccine almost destroyed me,' Malcolm says. 'I want justice for my family, and the hundreds of others whose lives have been ruined.'\n","**Gold label summary**: BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant had a yellow fever vaccine . 24 hours later he had been reduced to a sweating, shivering wreck .

The treasurer of a voluntary organisation drained £90,000 from the group's account - spending thousands on restaurant meals and trips to France. John Howard, 66, from Canterbury, Kent, had been a member of the Overseas Press and Media Association for 30 years but began stealing funds two years ago, leaving the company facing bankruptcy. The father-of-three had sole access to the non-profit organisation's account and enjoyed dining alone on several £300 meals a month and also spent money on flowers, a court heard. His fraud was only uncovered after the association had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. He was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court. Prosecutor Tony Prosser said Howard secretly sacked auditors and then presented the association with fake accounts each month. Between 2011 to 2013 he freely dipped into the money and lavished cash on himself and his family. When his crime came to light just £180 was left in the association's savings account when it should have been nearly £80,000. Howard rang a fellow member from a pay phone admitting the fraud and offering to repay £20,000. Mr Prosser said police found he had blown thousands on meals, groceries, flowers, expenditure in France, hotels and even sending money to his wife. Howard, who admitted fraud by breach of trust, claimed he only took £67,000 and had now put his home up for sale in a bid to repay some of the money. Dominic Webber, defending, said Howard got into debt and used the money to pay bills and was 'extremely sorry for what he has done.' Matt Findel-Hawkins, a former OPMA president, said: 'It wasn't like he was paying off debts to some evil Shylock figure. This was blatant, categorical deceit over time. His fraud was only uncovered after OPMA had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. The non-profit trade association services the international advertising community . 'At the same time he would sit there in meetings, smiling at us.' Mr Findel-Hawkins, sales director for Nikkei Europe, said Howard had been a member of the non-profit organisation for 30 years. He said: 'We'd have meetings and all go to lunch. He was a steady guy with a nice sense of humour. 'That's why he was our treasurer. We've been trying to work out what went wrong. If I ever spoke to him again, I'd just want to know why he did it.' Sentencing, Judge Simon James told Howard his victim was a not-for-profit organisation which had been operating for more than 80 years. 'Under your three-year tenure as treasurer - in which you seemed to treat its bank account as your own - they were left close to bankruptcy and perilously close to folding,' he said. 'Your good name has now been well and truly lost. This was a systematic, prolonged and flagrant piece of dishonesty. Howard was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court today . 'It seems to me the money was used to fund a comfortable living for you and your family rather than out of real desperation.' Detective Constable Barry Carr described it as a 'serious abuse of position' and said Howard had shown a 'flagrant disregard for the trust and responsibility placed in him'. He added that his deceit had nearly brought the long-established organisation to its knees financially.

The Ukip leader made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and Asian faces in the Ukip manifesto. It includes several photographs of the party's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage has dismissed criticism of the lack of diversity in Ukip's manifesto by claiming there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person' The question provoked noisy barracking, including from a group of black and Asian candidates attending the launch. Mr Farage said the premise was wrong, with the picture of the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe ignored. He told Magic Radio: 'Well firstly there was one fully black person.' Mr Farage added: 'There was another one of our leading spokesman who is half black and that didn't get a mention. And he featured very prominently on page six. So the premise was wrong. 'I thought what happened was really interesting. There was a journalist from one of our leading daily newspapers who made the comment you know, there's only one black. 'And what happened was that there was an eruption in the room as our black and ethnic minority candidates stood up and looked at this guy in a pretty hostile way.' The Ukip leader - trying on hats at a campaign stop in Canterbury, Kent, today - made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and Asian faces in the Ukip manifesto . The Ukip manifesto included several photographs of the party's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid . Mr Farage added: 'What they were saying was we're just about sick to death of the sneering media class trying to make Ukip out to be something completely other than it is. 'We're a non-racist, non-sectarian political party but we don't have all female quotas, we don't have all black quotas, we treat everybody as being equal. 'I think we're a multi-racial society. I think the multicultural society is a much more contentious point and perhaps that's the bit that may have gone slightly wrong. 'Over 10% of our candidates come from BME backgrounds. We're probably more diverse in our membership than some of the other parties who talk about all of this in a sort of 'holier than thou' way.' Mr Farage said the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe - who has dual heritage - was 'half black' The Ukip manifesto launch was overshadowed by a row over the number of black and Asian people included, after a journalist pointed out that the only image showed someone from an ethnic minority - an African woman in the overseas aid section . Ukip has also proposed to amend the smoking ban to allow pubs and clubs to open smoking rooms. The manifesto states these rooms would have to be properly ventilated and physically separate from non-smoking areas. Mr Farage said: 'There are 76 pages in our manifesto and that is one little sentence tucked away in there. 'It's about freedom of choice that's the point. Thirty pubs a week are closing and a lot of them particularly in built up areas where they haven't got a big food trade. 'They rely on people going into the pub at five, six o'clock after a hard day's work and a lot of those people might not smoke all day but they want a smoke with their drink that evening.' He added of his party's policy: 'Would that burden the health service? Well let's put it like this: the NHS says, that smoking related illnesses cost it £2 billion a year, all right?

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy.

The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report.

Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . She was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities.

The NHS does not routinely remove the type of tumour Colby had, instead treating the condition with medication. This week, Colby had the tumour removed free-of-charge thanks to the US-based Little Baby Face Foundation (LBFF). His mother Aimee, 18, said: 'Seeing Colby come out without the birthmark is the best thing ever. It makes me incredibly happy.

Colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma, a  tumour, swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the endothelial cells. These growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed. Ms Ramos-Francis, from Corsham, Wiltshire, who endured a 46-hour labour, said she noticed something different straight after the birth. She said: 'He had a small, pink birthmark on the side of his eye and it was in the same shape as a love-heart. 'I wasn't really that concerned about it because a lot of children are born with them. 'After we got home and we'd settled in with Colby we went for a six-week check up. 'By that time his birthmark had ballooned and it was really bulbous and it wasn't really a nice sight. 'It should have shrunk by the age of one but it hadn't made any progress.' She said doctors in Britain used a range of topical medications and pills - including propranolol - to try and reduce the swelling, but to no avail. The toddler's parents say they were also been the victims of abuse and slurs over their son's appearance, and feared for his chances of living a 'normal' life . His mother added: 'In England they seemed to be picking random numbers hoping it would make a difference, hoping it would shrink it, but it didn't make a difference. 'They then offered steroids but I didn't think it would be right giving a baby steroids, I was against it. 'We didn't really have much of an option except the wait-and-see approach, which we knew deep down really wasn't the best thing for Colby. 'The lady we were seeing eventually said we could possibly see a plastic surgeon - but that it would take years for him to be seen. 'It was a shock we would have to wait that long for surgery. It was heartbreaking.' On top of medical worries, Colby was banned from several daycare centres because of the risk of his growth weeping, leaving his mother unable to seek work while she studies English at the Open University. The toddler's parents say they have also been the victims of abuse and slurs over his appearance. Mr Francis, who works in a hardware store, said: 'We had very nasty comments about Colby and very nasty comments about ourselves. People have even asked if we are beating him. 'Others said \"why don't you get that disgusting thing removed from his face?\" 'It was difficult and it has been very hurtful at times. We just wanted Colby to have the best.' In February, a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon Dr Milton Waner (left) went ahead with a three-hour operation to cut the tumour away at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital . The operation, consultation fees, flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least £10,000 without the help of the foundation . Desperate, and frustrated with the lack of options in the UK, they turned to the New York-based Little Baby Face Foundation (LBFF), contacting them by Facebook. The charity specialises in treating children born with severe birthmarks and facial deformities. On February 5 this year, a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon Dr Milton Waner went ahead with a three-hour operation to cut the tumour away at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. The operation, consultation fees, flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least £10,000 without the help of the foundation. But with the level of expertise on offer, including other specialists, nurses and assistance, the figure would be 'much, much higher', the couple say. She said: 'Asking strangers for help can be amazing. We knew no-one in New York before this but they have done so much for us and Colby. We can't thank them enough.' Colby is just one many children to be helped by the LBFF since its founding by Dr Thomas Romo in 2002. Dr Romo said: 'Treating children with facial birth deformities is the most gratifying surgery I can perform. The NHS trust treating Colby before his surgery said that haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK . 'The Little Baby Face Foundation transforms not only the face of a child, but their entire life.' The family's claims they would have had to wait many years for plastic surgery have been denied by by Deborah Lee, deputy chief executive of University Hospital Bristol, where Colby received treatment. She said: 'The Trust does not recognise the parents' recollection of the information they were given. 'General advice for this condition in that UK practice is to treat conservatively in the initial stages in the hope that surgery would not be necessary, but even if a decision to proceed to surgery was reached, this would still be during the childhood years. 'Haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK. The standard treatment for the condition is propranolol, to which most haemangiomas respond well. 'In the event they do not, patients would be referred to a dermatologist. Any patient accepted for treatment is managed in accordance with national waiting-time standards, which aim to treat 90 per cent of patients within 18 weeks. 'We hope Colby's procedure in the USA was successful, and we wish him the very best for the future.' Colby will now be monitored remotely from New York with the family sending photographs back to the hospital every week.

Now that the heels have been kicked off, the cameras put down, and the last bottle of champagne drunk, FEMAIL take a look back at the week, taking note of the trends emerging from the shows, the beautiful designs we can't wait to hang in our wardrobes and the trends we won't be trying any time soon. Some dazzling creations had fashion spectators dreaming of an occasion special enough to warrant a couture price tag, other trends were so wearable we wanted to snap them up straight off the model's backs... while a few were downright bizarre. Make-up trends and accessories threatened to overshadow many of the designs being showcased, with stylists going over the top to stand out with head pieces, masks and other adornments bordering on the ridiculous. The week that was: MBFWA featured loud prints, metallic, intricate detailing in couture masterpieces from highlight shows Romance Was Born (left), Toni Maticevski (L) and Steven Khalil (middle R)... and some very different beauty looks and trends we won't try in real life (R) Bigger was better this week with voluminous silhouettes appearing again and again at some of the star shows, including Maticevski and Michael Lo Sordo. Skin is definitely in - flimsy, sheer fabrics were a fixture on the catwalk, with the front row receiving an eyeful as breasts, backsides and everything else were put on display beneath see-through mesh and lace designs. A key beauty trend on the catwalk appeared to be face bling - both Akira Isogawa and Bondi Bather sent models down the runway with sequins and beads glued to their faces. Meanwhile eyebrow-raising head wear frequently outshone the designs on parade - from perspex masks made to look like plastic bags blowing in the wind, to giant animal heads, and Ned Kelly-inspired head pieces. METALLICS . Shine on: Maticevski (left), Ginger & Smart (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) wowed with metallic golds and bronzes . Metals were a recurring feature on the catwalk. Head-to-toe gold dazzled at Toni Maticevski, while Johanna Johnson showed full-length skirts. Ginger & Smart's bronze dresses were favourites for their wear-ability off the catwalk. VOLUMINOUS SILHOUETTES . Big is better: Toni Maticevski (left), Ellery (middle), and Michael Lo Sordo (right) all presented voluminous silhouettes . The future is now: Contemporary styles by Maticevski (left and right) and Romance Was Born (middle) were masterpieces of design, wearability is questionable . Big is better - silhouettes went super-sized at many of the highlight shows. Maticevski, Romance Was Born, Ellery and Michael Lo Sordo all presented billowing, voluminous gowns. SLOUCHY COMFORT . Pyjama party: Laid-back, slouchy silhouettes featured in the (L-R) Haryono Setiadi, Gary Bigeni, Tome, and Serpent & The Swan shows will make for a comfortable season . Next season looks to be a comfortable one. As well as the oversized evening wear being showcased, ready-to-wear separates were inspired by bedtime.

Dazzling: Couture creations made a splash - our favourites were seen at (L-R) Galanni, Steven Khalil, and Johanna Johnson . Masterpiece: Betty Tran on Thursday night presented a show-stopping gown . Heavenly show-stopping masterpieces were highlights of the week, with intricate hand-sewn embellishments, fringing, feathers, and sheer fabrics key trends.

Sheer delight: Delicate sheer fabrics left little to the imagination at Mariam Seddiq (left), Kate Sylvester (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) Things got a little cheeky mid-week, particularly amongst the up-and-coming designers, who strived to stand out during the New Generation and Raffles Showcase presentations. Marriam Seddiq during the St George New Generation show and Any Step during the Raffles International Showcase in particular had the front row blushing, with their see-through creations that put models' bodies on full display. The Any Step show stood out for its bondage-style dress made of only leather straps and buckles. GLADIATORS ARE BACK . Lace it up: Bec & Bridge (left), CS Edit X Kirrily Johnston (middle), and Daniel Avakian (right) all showed knee-high Gladiator sandals . Oh, hello 2008. Your favourite footwear trend is back again.

BIZARRE 'BEAUTY' Don't try this at home: One Fell Swoop (left), Akira Isogawa (middle), and Dyspnea (right) tried out some interesting hair and beauty styles that we won't be trying in real life . The beauty looks of the week were met with some head scratching. 'Ugly' beauty, and unusual trends including sequinned faces are styles best left on the catwalk. Hair was repeatedly slicked down, while some hair designers got crafty, creating 'origami' influenced hair style and sectioning off strands of hair to create unique designs (pictured at Dyspnea). ACCESSORISE THIS . Hats off to you: Blue Glue Bikinis (left), Vanessa Moe (middle) and Romance Was Born (right) were in the headlines for their out-there headwear on the runway which included oversized animal heads, perspex masks, and Ned Kelly-inspired headpieces .

Both Ellery and Gail Sorronda's models sported circular ear pieces or earrings on one side only. STRONG IS THE NEW SKINNY . Sporty: We Are Handsome made headlines for casting fitness influences instead of regular models for their show (left and right), while Bec & Bridge's debut Swim line show featured healthier models (middle) The We Are Handsome show made headlines when design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers chose to cast fitness influencers rather than traditional models in their shows. Lindy Klim, along with former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter Amanda Bisk, Australian Ballet star Juliette Burnett, and Yogi and Instagram star Sjana Earp, wowed the crowds as they struck strong poses and modelled the brand's new Activewear range. SPECTACULAR SETTINGS . Unique: The iconic Icebergs pool was drained on Thursday to create a spectacular seaside catwalk for Ten Pieces . Australiana: The Art Gallery of NSW was transformed into a colourful floral setting for the Romance Was Born show . Moving: The Ellery show featured a performance by the Australian Ballet . While most of the shows took place at the Carriageworks venue in Eveleigh, a few designers went rogue, putting on shows in a more spectacular fashion with elaborate sets, locations and stunts. Ellery's opening show featured a performance by the Australian Ballet and Romance Was Born were typically stand-out with their floral setting inside the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Bloomfield, who worked at BBC Radio Derby for 10 years as a presenter, reporter and Derby County commentator, died at a hospice near his hometown of Shrewsbury yesterday morning. Fellow broadcasters have paid tribute to the 'perfect colleague' and ‘consummate professional’ whose positive outlook on life made him such a popular figure. And Derby County supporter Niall Horan, who is one quarter of boyband One Direction, has also described Bloomfield as a ‘super great guy and great commentator’. Hugely popular BBC Derby broadcaster Colin Bloomfield has died aged 33 after battling skin cancer . One Direction star and Derby County supporter Niall Horan (pictured together) was among the first to pay tribute to Bloomfield, who passed away yesterday at a hospice in Shrewsbury following a battle with cancer . The star, who has met Bloomfield several times, said on Twitter: 'Sad to hear to hear of the passing of Colin Bloomfield. He was a super great guy and great commentator. 'And had a huge passion for Derby county, he will be sadly missed around the ground, condolences to his family and friends.' Bloomfield lost his battle with cancer after it spread around his body from a cancerous mole. The malignant melanoma was removed from his leg 10 years ago but returned in 2013 and last year he was given only months to live. Heartbroken colleagues paid tribute to the talented broadcaster following the news he had passed away at 7.05am yesterday. Radio Derby's editor Simon Cornes said: 'Reporter, producer, commentator, presenter - Colin was all of those. 'You're lucky in radio if you're good at one of these things but Colin's talent was a rare one and he was extraordinarily accomplished at all of them. He made it seem easy. We know it isn't. 'If you were designing the perfect colleague you'd come up with Colin. His modesty was disarming but it was his warmth and his positive attitude to life that made him so popular with everyone at Radio Derby. 'We've lost our friend but it's a mark of the man that so many of our listeners feel they've lost their friend too. All of us are going to miss him dreadfully.' Bloomfield (pictured with fellow broadcasters Ant and Dec) died early yesterday morning at the age of 33 . Dozens left emotional tributes to Bloomfield on Twitter last night, including Niall Horan from One Direction, Burton Albion manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and glamour model  Maria Fowler . Derby County spokesman Colin Gibson, who had worked with Bloomfield at BBC Radio Derby, said: 'As a broadcaster he was the consummate professional. 'He could be - at one time - eulogising about what was happening at Neighbours and the next turn he'd being interviewing the prime minister and he would do them both brilliantly. He could really turn his hand to anything. 'His bravery during his fight with cancer had to be admired, preferring always to talk about the Rams or his beloved Shrewsbury Town rather than the pain he was going through.' Derby County president Sam Rush said: 'He will be sadly missed by everyone at Derby County Football Club as we had a tremendous working relationship with him. 'He can only be described as an inspirational individual and both a wonderful and humble young man.' At Derby's match away at Millwall yesterday that finished 3-3, Rams' supporters chanted his name, singing 'there's only one Colin Bloomfield'. And as Shrewsbury Town won promotion to League One after beating Cheltenham Town 1-0, the Shrewsbury players revealed t-shirts paying tribute to Bloomfield. Posting the tribute on its official Twitter page later, the club accompanied a picture of the players with: 'FOR THE FANS: Shrewsbury Town players don shirts with Colin Bloomfield and Lloyd Burton on!' Lloyd Burton, a young supporter of the club, also lost his battle with cancer this week. As Shrewsbury Town won promotion to League One after beating Cheltenham Town 1-0 yesterday, the Shrewsbury players revealed T-shirts paying tribute to Bloomfield and young supporter Lloyd Burton, who also passed away from cancer this week. The T-shirts read: 'For you Lloyd Burton and Chris Bloomfield' (pictured) Also paying tribute was fellow broadcaster Jake Humphrey, who wrote on Twitter: 'Devastated Colin Bloomfield has lost his fight. Ten minutes on the phone to him and you were walking on air all day.' Henry Winter, from the Daily Telegraph, added: 'RIP Colin Bloomfield. Hugely respected BBC football commentator and presenter. Only 33. Thoughts with his family, friends and colleagues.' And broadcaster Mike Sewell said: 'Extremely sad to hear that broadcaster Colin Bloomfield has passed away. Life is precious and at times cruelly short. RIP.' Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, manager of League Two side Burton Albion, wrote: 'I might add deeply saddened by the untimely death of the very popular BBC presenter Colin Bloomfield.' Maria Fowler, a glamour model and former The Only Way Is Essex star who grew up in Derby, also paid tribute to Bloomfield. In a series of messages, she said: 'I've just heard the news and am so so sad. Rest in Peace Colin Bloomfield. A truly brave and amazing man. You were amazing. I'm so sad. 'I'm so so sad. You were so brave Colin and now with the Angels. You will be so missed by everyone in Derby.' And Bloomfield's former colleague Jonno Baker wrote: 'Rest In Peace to my friend and the bravest man I've ever known. You were an incredible person.' Bloomfield (pictured) had set up a charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis which has so far raised £60,000 . These were the last tweets written by Colin Bloomfield, who passed away at a hospice near Shrewsbury today . Bloomfield's most recent battle with melanoma started in September 2013, but he was no stranger to the disease having first encountered it in 2001. A cancerous mole was operated on and turned out to be a malignant melanoma. Five years later, in 2006, he was given the all-clear. But in May 2013, he discovered a lump on his groin. Since then he had been undergoing various treatments and initially that helped shrink some of the tumours in his brains and lungs. However, further scans in the last few weeks revealed the tumours in his brain were increasing in size and earlier this month, he went to a hospice near his home town of Shrewsbury. After a courageous fight, he lost his final battle at 7.05am yesterday morning. A charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis has so far raised  £60,000 in just over two months. The money will be used to make hundreds of schools in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire 'sun safe', by educating youngsters about skin cancer prevention.\n","**Gold label summary**: BBC Radio Derby broadcaster died in hospice at 7.05am yesterday morning .

Justin Welby will say in his Easter sermon that 148 Christian students slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday were ‘witnesses’ to their faith and suffered ‘cruel deaths’. His comments follow Pope Francis’s denunciation of the ‘senseless’ killings at Garissa University College, in which Christians were singled out and shot. The Pope said in a Good Friday service in Rome that too many were guilty of a ‘complicit silence’ in the face of such attacks. In an overtly religious Easter message, David Cameron says it was ‘truly shocking’ that Christians were still tortured or killed because of their faith in much of the world. Their outspoken comments came as three people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack in the north-east of Kenya, bringing the total number of suspects being held to five. The Kenyan Government said the three, who were trying to cross into Somalia, are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school, who is believed to have co-ordinated the attack. Meanwhile, a survivor of the killings was found yesterday two days after the massacre. Cynthia Charotich, 19, hid in cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge when classmates came out of hiding at the demand of the Al-Shabaab gunmen. Archbishop Welby will also refer in his sermon in Canterbury Cathedral to other Christians killed in massacres, including in Libya, saying: ‘There have been so many martyrs in the last year.’ 148 Christian studentsat Garissa University College, Kenya, were slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday.

Producing beef, for example, requires large amounts of water, land for grazing and emits tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But now Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft and philanthropist, has said it may in fact be possible to keep eating meat and still care for the planet. Scroll down for video . Bill Gates, a failed vegetarian, says the world's demand for meat can be met with 'moderation and innovation' In his most recent blog post, the world's richest man, has defended meat eating, saying was unrealistic to expect large numbers of people to become vegetarian. He also explains that some of the impacts of meat farming have been overstated. Instead he believes it will be possible to provide enough meat for the world's growing population as demand in developing countries increases. Scientists have already cooked up the first test tube beef burger, but now researchers in Israel are working on the world's first lab-grown chicken. Professor Amit Gefen, a bioengineer at Tel Aviv University, . has begun a year-long feasibility study into manufacturing . chicken in a lab, funded by a non-profit group called the Modern . Agriculture Foundation which hopes 'cultured meat' will one day . replace the raising of animals for slaughter. The foundation's co-founder Shir Friedman hopes to have . produced 'a recipe for how to culture chicken cells' by the end . of the year. The researchers say their task is more difficult than . producing the first lab-grown hamburger, a $300,000 beef patty . cooked up at Maastricht University in the Netherlands after five . years of research financed by Google co-founder Sergey . Brin. To make the beef burger muscle fibers were grown in the lab from stem cells taken from a cow. These tiny chunks were then combined to make the beef burger. Those who tasted it said it was like meat, but not 'juicy'. Professor Gefen, however, is hoping to make a whole piece of . chicken, starting from a single cell. He said: 'Although it might be possible to get people in richer countries to eat less or shift toward less-intensive meats like chicken, I don't think it's realistic to expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions. 'Evolution turned us into omnivores. 'But there are reasons to be optimistic. For one thing, the world's appetite for meat may eventually level off. 'Consumption has plateaued and even declined a bit in many rich countries, including France, Germany, and the United States. 'I also believe that innovation will improve our ability to produce meat.' The consumption of meat has met with considerable criticism in recent years as climate change experts have warned about the harm it is doing to the planet. A recent report from Chatham House said that the global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than cars, planes, trains and ships combined. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also found that dietary change was also necessary to 'substantially lower' emissions. Lord Stern, the economist appointed by the British government to assess the financial impacts of climate change, has also urged people to give up meat. However, calls for widespread vegetarianism have been deeply unpopular with the general public. Some researchers have also estimated that it takes several thousand litres of water to produce just one kilogram of beef due to the water needed to grow feed for them. Cattle, like those above, and other livestock produce more greenhouse gas globally than transport emissions . Bill Gates has invested some of his fortune into projects aimed at finding sustainable solutions to problems in poverty stricken areas of the world including turning sewage water into clean drinking water (shown above) This makes livestock farming increasingly difficult in areas hit by drought. Cattle grazing can also take valuable land that could be used to grow more affordable agricultural crops. Demand for meat is expected to soar over the next 30 years or so, with global beef consumption rising from 64 million tonnes in 2005 to 106 million tonnes in 2050 according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. It also says pork demand will rise from 100 million tonnes to 143 million tonnes and chicken consumption will increase from 82 million tonnes to 181 million tonnes. However, Mr Gates, who set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife to fund research into sustainable technology that can tackle poverty around the world, said some of the impacts of meat have been overstated. He points to research that suggests most of the water needed for livestock production is known as green-water, which is used to grow grass. Global demand for beef, like the steak above, is expected to soar to 181 million tonnes by 2050 but Mr Gates says that it should be possible to meet this as some of the environmental impacts of meat are overstated . Most of this green water comes from rainfall and also evaporates back into the atmosphere, meaning it is not lost. He said: 'One study that excluded green water found that it takes just 44 litres – not thousands – to produce a kilo of beef.' Mr Gates has also been funding new research projects aimed at producing meat substitutes and says he has been impressed with the results. Companies like Beyond Meat and Hampton Creek Foods have been experimenting with turning plant proteins into foods that taste and look like meat and eggs. Mr Gates also explains that he once dabbled with being vegetarian himself in his late twenties but found he couldn't keep it going. He argues that meat is an important source of nutrition needed to help children develop healthy and said it was important that people in developing countries have access to these foods. He said: 'With a little moderation and more innovation, I do believe the world can meet its need for meat.'\n","**Gold label summary**: Billionaire Microsoft founder has defended meat eating in his latest blog .

Britain’s biggest grocer operated a multimillion-pound fleet of five aircraft for its bosses, but after a disastrous year new chief executive Dave Lewis admitted the planes gave the wrong image and put them up for sale. Four have been sold and the final one, a Hawker 800, will be gone by the end of next month. A similar plane can cost up to £67,000 to charter. Tesco's old Gulfstream 550, worth around £30 million,  that was capable of flying 14 executives at a time . Just days ago, Tesco managed to sell its seven-year-old, Gulfstream 550, worth around £30million new. It was capable of flying 14 executives at a time. With a top speed of 580mph, powered by two Rolls-Royce engines, it was the height of luxury, kitted out with DVD players, widescreen TVs and a bar . It even had cabins allowing executives to sleep in full-sized beds on longer journeys to America and Asia. Mr Lewis hopes the sale of the fleet will draw a line under a difficult year in which Tesco lurched from crisis to crisis, including a fraud investigation into after a £263million black hole emerged in its accounts. The supermarket haemorrhaged senior staff losing its chairman, chief executive and finance director while being hit hard by competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen customers. In September Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever. However less than four weeks after informing the City he no longer wanted to maintain the fleet, Lewis could not resist hopping onto a private jet to visit seven locations in Asia in four days. A spokesman said: ‘In October we said we would dispose of the five aircraft we operated. The last aircraft will be handed back by the end of May at the latest. Tesco spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world between 2005 and 2012 . ‘The aircraft have not been used by Tesco since December. In future we will use chartered aircraft only if there is a compelling business justification and travel cannot be completed by scheduled airline.’ Between 2005 and 2012 the firm has spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world. Previous chief executive Sir Terry Leahy has been reported as saying he preferred flights with EasyJet than flying on private jets but still managed to spend £2.3 million on the planes in 2009. The bill increased dramatically under the management of former boss Phil Clarke. In February 2011 under the tenure of Clarke it had jumped to £8.9 million. A brand new Gulfstream was delivered and sold almost immediately in November along with a Cessna Citation and another Hawker.\n","**Gold label summary**: Tesco operated multimillion-pound a fleet of five aircraft for its bosses .

A friend of the distraught family said: ‘The girlfriend of the co-pilot has nothing to do with what happened. ‘But the hatred of the world is coming down upon her, and you know this place is so small, it is very hard for them to come back here. ‘They would have to look to find somewhere to stay around here if they wanted to get away. It is just not possible for them to keep a low profile so they are not coming back. ‘It is so much easier if you live in Dusseldorf or somewhere like that. ‘But for the parents to come back here, it was almost impossible for them, it is just too small a town.’ An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death. Kathrin Goldbach and her family are said to be afraid of being blamed for the Germanwings crash, caused by Andreas Lubitz after he flew the plane he was co-piloting into the French Alps . An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death . Family members were also said to have joined the couple – who first met while working in a local Burger King as teenagers - on the final holiday. Miss Goldbach left her teaching job in Montabaur after Lubitz qualified as a pilot in 2013 and the pair moved to a flat in Dusseldorf. She got a job in a secondary school in a town called Krefeld just outside of the city. The young teacher also confirmed that in the weeks before the crash he had bought ‘his and her’ luxury Audi’s for himself and Miss Goldbach. Yesterday, it was claimed that footage showing the last few seconds inside the doomed flight had been found among the wreckage of the crash site . French prosecutor Brice Robin has called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities . A source close to the investigation said: ‘His girlfriend was very nervous in the interview. She had a female minister with her to try to keep her calm but she was wringing her hands and was very tense. ‘She knew he was ill but had no idea he was in this state of mind. He showed no signs of suicidal thoughts.’ Yesterday French prosecutor Brice Robin called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities. The demand came after German and French media reported having seen a video recording showing the final chaotic scenes of the flight as it hurled towards the Alps mountainside. Mr Robin said investigators were not yet examining mobile phones found at the crash site, and he was not aware of footage from phones having been recovered.\n","**Gold label summary**: Kathrin Goldbach's family are reportedly afraid to face 'hatred of the world' Her boyfriend Andreas Lubitz flew the plane he was co-piloting into Alps .

Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with Nilobon Patty in a separate venue in Hua Hin, a resort some 125miles southwest of Bangkok, shortly before his death. Ms Patty, 35, also known as Patty Patrick, has been accused of 'indirectly causing his death' as seeing her with another man had angered Mr Mackay, but claims she has done nothing wrong. Tragic: Iain Mackay's Thai girlfriend Nilobon Patty, known as Patty Patrick, has denied any involvement in the death of the 40-year-old Scot . According to Ms Patty, the couple had been seeing each other for three years, but that Mr Mackay ended their relationship last month as his work overseas prevented him from settling down with her. She claims she was not with another man, but out with friends, when an 'obviously drunk' Mr Mackay appeared in the bar around 1am. Tragic: Mr Mackay, 40, allegedly got into a fight after discovering Ms Patty talking to another man . Ms Patty claims Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, shouted at her, accused her of laughing at him, after which she decided to go home. Police informed her of Mr Mackay's incident in her place of work the next day, she told The Daily Record. 'I was told that Iain had gone there at 3am looking for me and I wasn't there,' she told the paper. 'People have been phoning me and making threats and saying I should leave Hua Hin. But I have done nothing wrong,' 'I don't know why anyone would say that I had anything to do with Iain's death. That is not true. It was just a terrible accident.' Thai police said Mr Mackay was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a pool bar near to the venue where he had spotted Ms Patty and the mystery man. Friends of Mr Mackay say that had posted links to his Ms Patty's Facebook page on the evening of his incident which showed her pictured with another man. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the pool shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Arguement: Mr Mackay bled to death after getting into a furious row at a bar in Hua Hin city . One friend said: 'Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.' Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Hua Hin, Thailand, on April 3.

Now new research revealed that male and female stegosaurus had different shaped plates running along their backs. It raises the prospect that the dinosaurs used its giant bony protrusions, which could reach up to 2.5 feet, to attract a mate. Scientists have found that male stegosaurus (top) had different shaped armoured plates to females (bottom) Palaeontologists say male stegosaurus could have used them to show off their prowess in much the same way as peacocks do today. The research has also helped to answer a problem that has baffled palaeontologists for decades. A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock in the mid-90s, but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the 'lovers'. Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. Some stegosaurus individuals have been found with wide plates while others had tall plates with a sharper tip that were 45 per cent smaller. Experts believed that these may have been two distinct species or individuals of a different age. However, using modern scanning techniques on a group of stegosaurus discovered at a 'graveyard' in central Montana, scientists have unraveled the answer. They found dinosaurs that had both sets of plates in the graveyard, suggesting they lived side-by-side. Apart from the different plates, their skeletons were identical. This makes it unlikely that they were different species and CT scanning has shown that the bones were not morphing into one or the other. This suggests they belonged to two different sexes instead. The research team believe that the males may have had the larger, broader plates for use in mating displays while the females had the sharper taller plates, that may have helped to discourage unwanted attention or predators. Evan Saitta, who conducted the work at the University of Bristol, said: 'As males typically invest more in their ornamentation, the larger, wide plates likely came from males. 'These broad plates would have provided a great display surface to attract mates. 'The tall plates might have functioned as prickly predator deterrents in females.' Stegosaurus, a herbivorous dinosaur, lived around 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period in the western United States. Along with its bony back, it also had large spikes on its tail that are thought to have been for defence or fights with rivals. Stegosaurus (above) lived around 150 million years ago but scientists have been baffled by differences between the shape of the plates on some fossils - leading some to believe they were different species . The new research on the armoured plates  may help scientists determine whether 'Sophie', the stegosaurus at the Natural History Museum in London pictured above, really is a female or if it was in fact a male dinosaur . Some dinosaur experts have speculated that the bony plates may have been covered in skin filled with blood vessels so they could flush with colour. This could have acted as a warning to predator or being used as a way of attracting attention of the opposite sex. Most dinosaur remains are difficult to determine the sex but there are a few that have been found to exhibit differences between males and females. Some had large crests or nose horns that may have been sexual features. Professor Paul Barrett, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London where one of the most complete stegosaur skeletons has just gone on display, said: 'It is interesting because it would add to the debate on what the plates were for. 'Sexual dimorphism is something we see a lot in modern animals, although it's not particularly prevalent in living reptiles or in living birds.' However he added: 'I'd like to see a lot more information on the graveyard site itself, the different sizes of the specimens, how they were arranged in the ground, more detail on the geology, and on the analyses that were done.' Evan Saitta (shown left with a stegosaurus armoured plate, used a CT scanner to examine the plates to see whether they might belong to different sexes. He is shown on the right cutting into the fossil to take samples .\n","**Gold label summary**: Stegosaurus fossils have been found with two different types of plate along their backs - large broad plates and taller sharper plates that are smaller .

AP McCoy celebrates Grand National victory on Don’t Push It in 2010 . Shutthefrontdoor, trained by Jonjo O’Neill, will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once-a-year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don’t Push It. In a perfect world, the National will finish with McCoy standing high in his irons celebrating but he, more than anyone, knows nothing is guaranteed in a sport as unpredictable as jump racing. It won’t, however, stop the 40-year-old hoping his script has a glorious finale. ‘I’m a dreamer,’ said McCoy, who announced his plans to retire in February. ‘I’m a believer – I always have been. McCoy seeks to end record-breaking career with victory on Shutthefrontdoor in the Grand National . 'If everyone has gone to bed thinking the dream will happen, I can promise you nobody has been dreaming more than me. In some ways, I regret making the announcement to retire when I did. I’ve thought to myself I should have just kept quiet. But in other ways I think it has been good. ‘If it’s created publicity for racing and helped get interest in the sport, so much the better. ‘Racing has been good to me and if this has been me giving something back, great.

Mention of that brought a wry smile from McCoy. ‘I wish it was as straightforward as running around a couple of bends at Ascot!’ he said. ‘I’ve got 30 fences and 38 other horses in my way!

His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'\n","**Gold label summary**: Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

When award-winning BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant walked into a clinic one afternoon to have a yellow fever vaccine, he was warned the possible side-effects could be dizzy spells and a headache. Yet within 24 hours of having the jab, in April 2011, Malcolm had been reduced to a sweating, shivering wreck, gripped by a fever so strong it took two weeks and a spell in hospital before his temperature was brought down. Then the psychosis began. A shooting star, glimpsed from the balcony of his home, convinced Malcolm - who had no previous history of mental illness - that he was a modern-day Messiah. 'I went completely bonkers,' he says today. 'The vaccine fried my brain.' Malcolm, 59, who had the jab in preparation for an assignment in the Ivory Coast, believed his Kindle could fly, that dead friends were contacting him and that he could stop traffic just by thinking about it. He spent the next two years in and out of mental institutions, unable to work - and even attempted suicide. Fortunately, he has since made a full recovery. But Malcolm believes the yellow fever vaccine - available in High Street vaccination clinics, GP surgeries and even Boots - could have dangerous side-effects that affect more people than previously thought. Since its invention in 1951, more than 540 million doses of the vaccine have been given. Anyone travelling to parts of Africa or South America is advised to have it. Yellow fever is a serious viral infection spread by mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite and nausea. While many people recover after five or six days, 15 per cent enter a second, toxic phase, with recurring fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice due to liver damage. They may also start vomiting blood. This toxic phase is fatal in about 20 per cent of cases. Clearly a dangerous illness, there is no doubt vaccination can be life-saving. But Malcolm and others who say they have been adversely affected by the jab want the manufacturer to investigate. Malcolm, who for many years was the Beeb's man in Greece, had the jab in a clinic in Athens, where his family was living. Next morning, his new wife Trine, found him downstairs, shivering and sweating, his face beetroot red. 'I was beside myself with worry,' says Trine, 55, an author and journalist. 'It wasn't just the fever but the change in character. He became irrational, then emotional - crying.' When his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days, Trine took Malcolm to hospital. The doctors, who also discovered through blood tests that Malcolm had suffered recent liver damage, told him they believed he'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side-effects . They managed to lower his temperature. But his mental problems were only just beginning. Formerly agnostic, Malcolm became convinced he was Jesus, and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication. It was a harrowing time for Trine. 'One day I visited him in hospital and he stripped off his clothes and asked me to turn the sheet into a nappy and put it on him so everyone could see he was Jesus,' she says. 'Doctors had told me not to upset him, just to do what he asked, so I did it. It was heartbreaking.' After three weeks, Malcolm was discharged in May 2011, and seemed to be recovering, so went back to work. But within weeks he deteriorated again. Malcolm developed full-blown psychosis, and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the UK, Greece, and eventually with money running out, in Trine's native Copenhagen. On one occasion he attempted to take his own life. Happily, Malcolm was well enough to be discharged from hospital in July 2012 and has since made a full recovery. He is now pursuing the manufacturers of the vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, to admit liability for what happened to him. As Trine explains: 'Every doctor we dealt with said they thought he'd suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Since May 2011 I have been back to Sanofi Pasteur many times, but they are refusing to do anything or even meet us.' Malcolm is not the only person who believes they have had an adverse reaction to the drug. He is in touch with 12 others who believe they, too, have suffered grave side-effects. The NHS says that up to three in ten people who are immunised with the yellow fever vaccine suffer a mild headache, muscle aches, mild fever or soreness at the injection site - and that these symptoms occur because your immune system is trying to fight the small dose of yellow fever you have been injected with. These symptoms may last for up to 14 days after the injection. It's thought that far fewer people, four in a million, suffer more serious psychotic or neurological reactions, mainly unconnected to the symptoms of yellow fever itself. One of those is former Royal Naval Commander Graham Beard, who is convinced the jab, which he had in July 1999, ruined his health. He still suffers bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches (posed by model) A fortnight after being given the injection, Graham, now 56, experienced terrible pains down his left side. He spent three weeks in Watford General Hospital and another three in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queens Square, London. 'No diagnosis was made, except that I had suffered a major neurological illness,' says Graham, a father-of-two from Wales. After three months at home convalescing, Graham - who had also been unable to move - finally got movement back in his limbs and the pain disappeared. But then began a series of debilitating attacks which continue to this day. 'While now controlled by epilepsy medication, I still suffer bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches, which occur sometimes daily or with gaps of several days or weeks,' he says. 'The most I have ever had is 19 in a single day. The stress and exhaustion from these attacks essentially stopped my career. I managed to hang on for ten years, but by 2010, after 32 years in the Navy, I realised I wasn't being fair on the team. 'Having struggled to accommodate the condition, while taking a staggering succession of medications and having constant tests, it finally beat me and I had to walk away from the career I loved.' Graham always mentioned to specialists that his symptoms seemed to have begun after he had the yellow fever jab and, consequently, he has been advised by medical professionals it's likely that a vaccine caused the problem. But it was only after hearing about other cases such as Malcolm's that he decided to speak out. 'Surely the company that makes the vaccine has a moral duty to review it to see if it should be modified or replaced,' says Graham. As long ago as 2005, Dr Thomas Monath, a former Harvard public health professor and world expert on yellow fever, confirmed that the vaccine can cause 'really severe and significant adverse events'. He told Good Health: 'While we should not overlook the 60 years of wide use of yellow fever vaccine, with a remarkable record of safety and effective prevention of this terrible disease, rare and unusual adverse events temporally associated with vaccination may occur. Some of these, such as the neuropsychiatric syndromes described in Mr Brabant's case, may not be acknowledged as causally related in the official literature.' The manufacturer, however, does not believe it needs to reassess the vaccine. In 2013 Dr Ronald Neeleman, head of vaccination innovation at Sanofi Pasteur, admitted to a conference that the vaccine hadn't been reviewed in many years, saying it serves 'a small market, with very low returns, and there is not really an incentive to redevelop'. A spokesman told Good Health that the company takes reports of adverse events 'very seriously' and ensures they are investigated promptly, but 'after carefully examining all the medical information that has been disclosed to us up to April 2013, we have been unable to establish any evidence for a causal relationship between the administration of the yellow fever vaccine Stamaril and Mr Brabant's reported medical condition. 'The current state of scientific knowledge does not support that these reported symptoms could be biologically plausibly linked to the natural history of the disease, nor the mode of action of the vaccine. 'Similarly, the observation of an event after vaccination does not automatically mean that vaccination has caused this event.' Malcolm, who has written a book, Malcolm Is A Little Unwell, won't be satisfied until the experiences of people like him are acknowledged in official literature about the vaccine and he has been offered compensation. 'The vaccine almost destroyed me,' Malcolm says. 'I want justice for my family, and the hundreds of others whose lives have been ruined.'\n","**Gold label summary**: BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant had a yellow fever vaccine . 24 hours later he had been reduced to a sweating, shivering wreck .

The treasurer of a voluntary organisation drained £90,000 from the group's account - spending thousands on restaurant meals and trips to France. John Howard, 66, from Canterbury, Kent, had been a member of the Overseas Press and Media Association for 30 years but began stealing funds two years ago, leaving the company facing bankruptcy. The father-of-three had sole access to the non-profit organisation's account and enjoyed dining alone on several £300 meals a month and also spent money on flowers, a court heard. His fraud was only uncovered after the association had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. He was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court. Prosecutor Tony Prosser said Howard secretly sacked auditors and then presented the association with fake accounts each month. Between 2011 to 2013 he freely dipped into the money and lavished cash on himself and his family. When his crime came to light just £180 was left in the association's savings account when it should have been nearly £80,000. Howard rang a fellow member from a pay phone admitting the fraud and offering to repay £20,000. Mr Prosser said police found he had blown thousands on meals, groceries, flowers, expenditure in France, hotels and even sending money to his wife. Howard, who admitted fraud by breach of trust, claimed he only took £67,000 and had now put his home up for sale in a bid to repay some of the money. Dominic Webber, defending, said Howard got into debt and used the money to pay bills and was 'extremely sorry for what he has done.' Matt Findel-Hawkins, a former OPMA president, said: 'It wasn't like he was paying off debts to some evil Shylock figure. This was blatant, categorical deceit over time. His fraud was only uncovered after OPMA had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls. The non-profit trade association services the international advertising community . 'At the same time he would sit there in meetings, smiling at us.' Mr Findel-Hawkins, sales director for Nikkei Europe, said Howard had been a member of the non-profit organisation for 30 years. He said: 'We'd have meetings and all go to lunch. He was a steady guy with a nice sense of humour. 'That's why he was our treasurer. We've been trying to work out what went wrong. If I ever spoke to him again, I'd just want to know why he did it.' Sentencing, Judge Simon James told Howard his victim was a not-for-profit organisation which had been operating for more than 80 years. 'Under your three-year tenure as treasurer - in which you seemed to treat its bank account as your own - they were left close to bankruptcy and perilously close to folding,' he said. 'Your good name has now been well and truly lost. This was a systematic, prolonged and flagrant piece of dishonesty. Howard was jailed for two and a half years and mouthed 'I'm sorry' to a former colleague as he left the dock at Canterbury Crown Court today . 'It seems to me the money was used to fund a comfortable living for you and your family rather than out of real desperation.' Detective Constable Barry Carr described it as a 'serious abuse of position' and said Howard had shown a 'flagrant disregard for the trust and responsibility placed in him'. He added that his deceit had nearly brought the long-established organisation to its knees financially.

But there were no other clues (besides the fact that the words were written in English) as to where the couple might live. When she returned home to Palm Beach, Australia, Walsh was determined to reunite the ring with its owner. She went to the 5,000 members of her company's Facebook page, Kids in Adelaide, to reunite Joe and Jenny with the ring. She also created a \"Find Joe and Jenny\" page to track them down. \"Hi all. It's Roxy here. This is a reaaaallyy long shot but would love some SHARE love on this post to help find Joe. Found this gold ring snorkeling at Finns Beach in Bali today.

The Ukip leader made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and Asian faces in the Ukip manifesto. It includes several photographs of the party's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage has dismissed criticism of the lack of diversity in Ukip's manifesto by claiming there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person' The question provoked noisy barracking, including from a group of black and Asian candidates attending the launch. Mr Farage said the premise was wrong, with the picture of the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe ignored. He told Magic Radio: 'Well firstly there was one fully black person.' Mr Farage added: 'There was another one of our leading spokesman who is half black and that didn't get a mention. And he featured very prominently on page six. So the premise was wrong. 'I thought what happened was really interesting. There was a journalist from one of our leading daily newspapers who made the comment you know, there's only one black. 'And what happened was that there was an eruption in the room as our black and ethnic minority candidates stood up and looked at this guy in a pretty hostile way.' The Ukip leader - trying on hats at a campaign stop in Canterbury, Kent, today - made the remarks after being asked at his manifesto launch last week to justify the scarcity of black and Asian faces in the Ukip manifesto . The Ukip manifesto included several photographs of the party's top team although it was suggested the only black face in the document appeared on a page about overseas aid . Mr Farage added: 'What they were saying was we're just about sick to death of the sneering media class trying to make Ukip out to be something completely other than it is. 'We're a non-racist, non-sectarian political party but we don't have all female quotas, we don't have all black quotas, we treat everybody as being equal. 'I think we're a multi-racial society. I think the multicultural society is a much more contentious point and perhaps that's the bit that may have gone slightly wrong. 'Over 10% of our candidates come from BME backgrounds. We're probably more diverse in our membership than some of the other parties who talk about all of this in a sort of 'holier than thou' way.' Mr Farage said the party's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe - who has dual heritage - was 'half black' The Ukip manifesto launch was overshadowed by a row over the number of black and Asian people included, after a journalist pointed out that the only image showed someone from an ethnic minority - an African woman in the overseas aid section . Ukip has also proposed to amend the smoking ban to allow pubs and clubs to open smoking rooms. The manifesto states these rooms would have to be properly ventilated and physically separate from non-smoking areas. Mr Farage said: 'There are 76 pages in our manifesto and that is one little sentence tucked away in there. 'It's about freedom of choice that's the point. Thirty pubs a week are closing and a lot of them particularly in built up areas where they haven't got a big food trade. 'They rely on people going into the pub at five, six o'clock after a hard day's work and a lot of those people might not smoke all day but they want a smoke with their drink that evening.' He added of his party's policy: 'Would that burden the health service? Well let's put it like this: the NHS says, that smoking related illnesses cost it £2 billion a year, all right?

Speaking in the documentary Jason Robinson: Sports Life Stories, which will be broadcast on ITV4 at 10pm on Tuesday, the 40-year-old former dual-code international admitted he had been a heavy drinker during his early days at rugby league club Wigan, which almost led to his downfall.

However, it was his arrest for affray, assault and criminal damage which left him considering an attempt on his own life and he credits then team-mate and Samoa star Va'aiga Tuigamala with turning things around. 'I can remember I just sat in my bedroom with an old knife, an old meat cleaver,' he recalled. 'I didn't want life to go on in this way. That night when I contemplated doing it, I wept like a baby.

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency.

Reaction: Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved'. However she still faces charges she had a threesome with the student and another teacher .

The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . She was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays.

His parents claim NHS doctors were unable to treat the growth or offer surgery, leaving them no option but to beg for help abroad. Scroll down for video . Colby Ramos-Francis, now 17 months old, was born with a small, heart-shaped growth over his eyelid. But it quickly developed into a large benign tumour that continued to expand, threatening his sight . Colby has now had the tumour removed free-of-charge thanks to the US-based Little Baby Face Foundation. His parents claim NHS doctors were unable to treat the growth or offer surgery, leaving them no option but to beg for help abroad . The NHS does not routinely remove the type of tumour Colby had, instead treating the condition with medication. This week, Colby had the tumour removed free-of-charge thanks to the US-based Little Baby Face Foundation (LBFF). His mother Aimee, 18, said: 'Seeing Colby come out without the birthmark is the best thing ever. It makes me incredibly happy. 'If it hadn't been removed properly it could have resulted in him losing his eyesight. It was so emotional seeing him trying to touch it and realising it was not there anymore. 'It is so nice not to have these worries anymore and he can just grow up and be happy.' While also delighted with the outcome, Colby's father Jamie, 23, said he was disappointed the family had been forced to fly across the Atlantic to get the treatment they desperately needed. He said: 'When someone like Josie Cunningham can have free plastic surgery on the NHS and Colby can't, it's just out of order. 'There is a huge waiting list for people like Colby but she can just come along, snap her fingers and gets it. It's heartbreaking.' Ms Cunningham sparked outrage when she announced she'd received a £4,800 boob job on the NHS. Colby, with his parents Jamie and Aimee. His mother said: 'If the growth hadn't been removed properly, it could have resulted in him losing his eyesight. It was so emotional seeing him trying to touch it and realising it was not there anymore' Colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma, a tumour, swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the endothelial cells. These growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed . Colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma, a  tumour, swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the endothelial cells. These growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed. Ms Ramos-Francis, from Corsham, Wiltshire, who endured a 46-hour labour, said she noticed something different straight after the birth. She said: 'He had a small, pink birthmark on the side of his eye and it was in the same shape as a love-heart. 'I wasn't really that concerned about it because a lot of children are born with them. 'After we got home and we'd settled in with Colby we went for a six-week check up. 'By that time his birthmark had ballooned and it was really bulbous and it wasn't really a nice sight. 'It should have shrunk by the age of one but it hadn't made any progress.' She said doctors in Britain used a range of topical medications and pills - including propranolol - to try and reduce the swelling, but to no avail. The toddler's parents say they were also been the victims of abuse and slurs over their son's appearance, and feared for his chances of living a 'normal' life . His mother added: 'In England they seemed to be picking random numbers hoping it would make a difference, hoping it would shrink it, but it didn't make a difference. 'They then offered steroids but I didn't think it would be right giving a baby steroids, I was against it. 'We didn't really have much of an option except the wait-and-see approach, which we knew deep down really wasn't the best thing for Colby. 'The lady we were seeing eventually said we could possibly see a plastic surgeon - but that it would take years for him to be seen. 'It was a shock we would have to wait that long for surgery. It was heartbreaking.' On top of medical worries, Colby was banned from several daycare centres because of the risk of his growth weeping, leaving his mother unable to seek work while she studies English at the Open University. The toddler's parents say they have also been the victims of abuse and slurs over his appearance. Mr Francis, who works in a hardware store, said: 'We had very nasty comments about Colby and very nasty comments about ourselves. People have even asked if we are beating him. 'Others said \"why don't you get that disgusting thing removed from his face?\" 'It was difficult and it has been very hurtful at times. We just wanted Colby to have the best.' In February, a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon Dr Milton Waner (left) went ahead with a three-hour operation to cut the tumour away at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital . The operation, consultation fees, flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least £10,000 without the help of the foundation . Desperate, and frustrated with the lack of options in the UK, they turned to the New York-based Little Baby Face Foundation (LBFF), contacting them by Facebook. The charity specialises in treating children born with severe birthmarks and facial deformities. On February 5 this year, a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon Dr Milton Waner went ahead with a three-hour operation to cut the tumour away at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. The operation, consultation fees, flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least £10,000 without the help of the foundation. But with the level of expertise on offer, including other specialists, nurses and assistance, the figure would be 'much, much higher', the couple say. She said: 'Asking strangers for help can be amazing. We knew no-one in New York before this but they have done so much for us and Colby. We can't thank them enough.' Colby is just one many children to be helped by the LBFF since its founding by Dr Thomas Romo in 2002. Dr Romo said: 'Treating children with facial birth deformities is the most gratifying surgery I can perform. The NHS trust treating Colby before his surgery said that haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK . 'The Little Baby Face Foundation transforms not only the face of a child, but their entire life.' The family's claims they would have had to wait many years for plastic surgery have been denied by by Deborah Lee, deputy chief executive of University Hospital Bristol, where Colby received treatment. She said: 'The Trust does not recognise the parents' recollection of the information they were given. 'General advice for this condition in that UK practice is to treat conservatively in the initial stages in the hope that surgery would not be necessary, but even if a decision to proceed to surgery was reached, this would still be during the childhood years. 'Haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK. The standard treatment for the condition is propranolol, to which most haemangiomas respond well. 'In the event they do not, patients would be referred to a dermatologist. Any patient accepted for treatment is managed in accordance with national waiting-time standards, which aim to treat 90 per cent of patients within 18 weeks. 'We hope Colby's procedure in the USA was successful, and we wish him the very best for the future.' Colby will now be monitored remotely from New York with the family sending photographs back to the hospital every week.

Some dazzling creations had fashion spectators dreaming of an occasion special enough to warrant a couture price tag, other trends were so wearable we wanted to snap them up straight off the model's backs... while a few were downright bizarre. Make-up trends and accessories threatened to overshadow many of the designs being showcased, with stylists going over the top to stand out with head pieces, masks and other adornments bordering on the ridiculous.

Skin is definitely in - flimsy, sheer fabrics were a fixture on the catwalk, with the front row receiving an eyeful as breasts, backsides and everything else were put on display beneath see-through mesh and lace designs. A key beauty trend on the catwalk appeared to be face bling - both Akira Isogawa and Bondi Bather sent models down the runway with sequins and beads glued to their faces. Meanwhile eyebrow-raising head wear frequently outshone the designs on parade - from perspex masks made to look like plastic bags blowing in the wind, to giant animal heads, and Ned Kelly-inspired head pieces.

Bloomfield, who worked at BBC Radio Derby for 10 years as a presenter, reporter and Derby County commentator, died at a hospice near his hometown of Shrewsbury yesterday morning. Fellow broadcasters have paid tribute to the 'perfect colleague' and ‘consummate professional’ whose positive outlook on life made him such a popular figure. And Derby County supporter Niall Horan, who is one quarter of boyband One Direction, has also described Bloomfield as a ‘super great guy and great commentator’. Hugely popular BBC Derby broadcaster Colin Bloomfield has died aged 33 after battling skin cancer . One Direction star and Derby County supporter Niall Horan (pictured together) was among the first to pay tribute to Bloomfield, who passed away yesterday at a hospice in Shrewsbury following a battle with cancer . The star, who has met Bloomfield several times, said on Twitter: 'Sad to hear to hear of the passing of Colin Bloomfield. He was a super great guy and great commentator. 'And had a huge passion for Derby county, he will be sadly missed around the ground, condolences to his family and friends.' Bloomfield lost his battle with cancer after it spread around his body from a cancerous mole. The malignant melanoma was removed from his leg 10 years ago but returned in 2013 and last year he was given only months to live. Heartbroken colleagues paid tribute to the talented broadcaster following the news he had passed away at 7.05am yesterday. Radio Derby's editor Simon Cornes said: 'Reporter, producer, commentator, presenter - Colin was all of those. 'You're lucky in radio if you're good at one of these things but Colin's talent was a rare one and he was extraordinarily accomplished at all of them. He made it seem easy. We know it isn't. 'If you were designing the perfect colleague you'd come up with Colin. His modesty was disarming but it was his warmth and his positive attitude to life that made him so popular with everyone at Radio Derby. 'We've lost our friend but it's a mark of the man that so many of our listeners feel they've lost their friend too. All of us are going to miss him dreadfully.' Bloomfield (pictured with fellow broadcasters Ant and Dec) died early yesterday morning at the age of 33 . Dozens left emotional tributes to Bloomfield on Twitter last night, including Niall Horan from One Direction, Burton Albion manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and glamour model  Maria Fowler . Derby County spokesman Colin Gibson, who had worked with Bloomfield at BBC Radio Derby, said: 'As a broadcaster he was the consummate professional. 'He could be - at one time - eulogising about what was happening at Neighbours and the next turn he'd being interviewing the prime minister and he would do them both brilliantly. He could really turn his hand to anything. 'His bravery during his fight with cancer had to be admired, preferring always to talk about the Rams or his beloved Shrewsbury Town rather than the pain he was going through.' Derby County president Sam Rush said: 'He will be sadly missed by everyone at Derby County Football Club as we had a tremendous working relationship with him. 'He can only be described as an inspirational individual and both a wonderful and humble young man.' At Derby's match away at Millwall yesterday that finished 3-3, Rams' supporters chanted his name, singing 'there's only one Colin Bloomfield'. And as Shrewsbury Town won promotion to League One after beating Cheltenham Town 1-0, the Shrewsbury players revealed t-shirts paying tribute to Bloomfield. Posting the tribute on its official Twitter page later, the club accompanied a picture of the players with: 'FOR THE FANS: Shrewsbury Town players don shirts with Colin Bloomfield and Lloyd Burton on!' Lloyd Burton, a young supporter of the club, also lost his battle with cancer this week. As Shrewsbury Town won promotion to League One after beating Cheltenham Town 1-0 yesterday, the Shrewsbury players revealed T-shirts paying tribute to Bloomfield and young supporter Lloyd Burton, who also passed away from cancer this week. The T-shirts read: 'For you Lloyd Burton and Chris Bloomfield' (pictured) Also paying tribute was fellow broadcaster Jake Humphrey, who wrote on Twitter: 'Devastated Colin Bloomfield has lost his fight. Ten minutes on the phone to him and you were walking on air all day.' Henry Winter, from the Daily Telegraph, added: 'RIP Colin Bloomfield. Hugely respected BBC football commentator and presenter. Only 33. Thoughts with his family, friends and colleagues.' And broadcaster Mike Sewell said: 'Extremely sad to hear that broadcaster Colin Bloomfield has passed away. Life is precious and at times cruelly short. RIP.' Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, manager of League Two side Burton Albion, wrote: 'I might add deeply saddened by the untimely death of the very popular BBC presenter Colin Bloomfield.' Maria Fowler, a glamour model and former The Only Way Is Essex star who grew up in Derby, also paid tribute to Bloomfield. In a series of messages, she said: 'I've just heard the news and am so so sad. Rest in Peace Colin Bloomfield. A truly brave and amazing man. You were amazing. I'm so sad. 'I'm so so sad. You were so brave Colin and now with the Angels. You will be so missed by everyone in Derby.' And Bloomfield's former colleague Jonno Baker wrote: 'Rest In Peace to my friend and the bravest man I've ever known. You were an incredible person.' Bloomfield (pictured) had set up a charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis which has so far raised £60,000 . These were the last tweets written by Colin Bloomfield, who passed away at a hospice near Shrewsbury today . Bloomfield's most recent battle with melanoma started in September 2013, but he was no stranger to the disease having first encountered it in 2001. A cancerous mole was operated on and turned out to be a malignant melanoma. Five years later, in 2006, he was given the all-clear. But in May 2013, he discovered a lump on his groin. Since then he had been undergoing various treatments and initially that helped shrink some of the tumours in his brains and lungs. However, further scans in the last few weeks revealed the tumours in his brain were increasing in size and earlier this month, he went to a hospice near his home town of Shrewsbury. After a courageous fight, he lost his final battle at 7.05am yesterday morning. A charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis has so far raised  £60,000 in just over two months. The money will be used to make hundreds of schools in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire 'sun safe', by educating youngsters about skin cancer prevention.\n","**Gold label summary**: BBC Radio Derby broadcaster died in hospice at 7.05am yesterday morning .

Justin Welby will say in his Easter sermon that 148 Christian students slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday were ‘witnesses’ to their faith and suffered ‘cruel deaths’. His comments follow Pope Francis’s denunciation of the ‘senseless’ killings at Garissa University College, in which Christians were singled out and shot. The Pope said in a Good Friday service in Rome that too many were guilty of a ‘complicit silence’ in the face of such attacks. In an overtly religious Easter message, David Cameron says it was ‘truly shocking’ that Christians were still tortured or killed because of their faith in much of the world. Their outspoken comments came as three people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attack in the north-east of Kenya, bringing the total number of suspects being held to five. The Kenyan Government said the three, who were trying to cross into Somalia, are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school, who is believed to have co-ordinated the attack. Meanwhile, a survivor of the killings was found yesterday two days after the massacre. Cynthia Charotich, 19, hid in cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge when classmates came out of hiding at the demand of the Al-Shabaab gunmen. Archbishop Welby will also refer in his sermon in Canterbury Cathedral to other Christians killed in massacres, including in Libya, saying: ‘There have been so many martyrs in the last year.’ 148 Christian studentsat Garissa University College, Kenya, were slaughtered by Somali gunmen on Thursday.

Jonas, a former world and European bronze medallist, said: 'It just felt like the right time to retire. 'Being away from camp to recover from my recent injury has given me time to think and I just came to the conclusion that I did not want to go back to the demands of full-time training.

Producing beef, for example, requires large amounts of water, land for grazing and emits tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But now Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft and philanthropist, has said it may in fact be possible to keep eating meat and still care for the planet. Scroll down for video . Bill Gates, a failed vegetarian, says the world's demand for meat can be met with 'moderation and innovation' In his most recent blog post, the world's richest man, has defended meat eating, saying was unrealistic to expect large numbers of people to become vegetarian. He also explains that some of the impacts of meat farming have been overstated. Instead he believes it will be possible to provide enough meat for the world's growing population as demand in developing countries increases. Scientists have already cooked up the first test tube beef burger, but now researchers in Israel are working on the world's first lab-grown chicken. Professor Amit Gefen, a bioengineer at Tel Aviv University, . has begun a year-long feasibility study into manufacturing . chicken in a lab, funded by a non-profit group called the Modern . Agriculture Foundation which hopes 'cultured meat' will one day . replace the raising of animals for slaughter. The foundation's co-founder Shir Friedman hopes to have . produced 'a recipe for how to culture chicken cells' by the end . of the year. The researchers say their task is more difficult than . producing the first lab-grown hamburger, a $300,000 beef patty . cooked up at Maastricht University in the Netherlands after five . years of research financed by Google co-founder Sergey . Brin. To make the beef burger muscle fibers were grown in the lab from stem cells taken from a cow. These tiny chunks were then combined to make the beef burger. Those who tasted it said it was like meat, but not 'juicy'. Professor Gefen, however, is hoping to make a whole piece of . chicken, starting from a single cell. He said: 'Although it might be possible to get people in richer countries to eat less or shift toward less-intensive meats like chicken, I don't think it's realistic to expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions. 'Evolution turned us into omnivores. 'But there are reasons to be optimistic. For one thing, the world's appetite for meat may eventually level off. 'Consumption has plateaued and even declined a bit in many rich countries, including France, Germany, and the United States. 'I also believe that innovation will improve our ability to produce meat.' The consumption of meat has met with considerable criticism in recent years as climate change experts have warned about the harm it is doing to the planet. A recent report from Chatham House said that the global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than cars, planes, trains and ships combined. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also found that dietary change was also necessary to 'substantially lower' emissions. Lord Stern, the economist appointed by the British government to assess the financial impacts of climate change, has also urged people to give up meat. However, calls for widespread vegetarianism have been deeply unpopular with the general public. Some researchers have also estimated that it takes several thousand litres of water to produce just one kilogram of beef due to the water needed to grow feed for them. Cattle, like those above, and other livestock produce more greenhouse gas globally than transport emissions . Bill Gates has invested some of his fortune into projects aimed at finding sustainable solutions to problems in poverty stricken areas of the world including turning sewage water into clean drinking water (shown above) This makes livestock farming increasingly difficult in areas hit by drought. Cattle grazing can also take valuable land that could be used to grow more affordable agricultural crops. Demand for meat is expected to soar over the next 30 years or so, with global beef consumption rising from 64 million tonnes in 2005 to 106 million tonnes in 2050 according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. It also says pork demand will rise from 100 million tonnes to 143 million tonnes and chicken consumption will increase from 82 million tonnes to 181 million tonnes. However, Mr Gates, who set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife to fund research into sustainable technology that can tackle poverty around the world, said some of the impacts of meat have been overstated. He points to research that suggests most of the water needed for livestock production is known as green-water, which is used to grow grass. Global demand for beef, like the steak above, is expected to soar to 181 million tonnes by 2050 but Mr Gates says that it should be possible to meet this as some of the environmental impacts of meat are overstated . Most of this green water comes from rainfall and also evaporates back into the atmosphere, meaning it is not lost. He said: 'One study that excluded green water found that it takes just 44 litres – not thousands – to produce a kilo of beef.' Mr Gates has also been funding new research projects aimed at producing meat substitutes and says he has been impressed with the results. Companies like Beyond Meat and Hampton Creek Foods have been experimenting with turning plant proteins into foods that taste and look like meat and eggs. Mr Gates also explains that he once dabbled with being vegetarian himself in his late twenties but found he couldn't keep it going. He argues that meat is an important source of nutrition needed to help children develop healthy and said it was important that people in developing countries have access to these foods. He said: 'With a little moderation and more innovation, I do believe the world can meet its need for meat.'\n","**Gold label summary**: Billionaire Microsoft founder has defended meat eating in his latest blog .

Britain’s biggest grocer operated a multimillion-pound fleet of five aircraft for its bosses, but after a disastrous year new chief executive Dave Lewis admitted the planes gave the wrong image and put them up for sale. Four have been sold and the final one, a Hawker 800, will be gone by the end of next month. A similar plane can cost up to £67,000 to charter. Tesco's old Gulfstream 550, worth around £30 million,  that was capable of flying 14 executives at a time . Just days ago, Tesco managed to sell its seven-year-old, Gulfstream 550, worth around £30million new. It was capable of flying 14 executives at a time. With a top speed of 580mph, powered by two Rolls-Royce engines, it was the height of luxury, kitted out with DVD players, widescreen TVs and a bar . It even had cabins allowing executives to sleep in full-sized beds on longer journeys to America and Asia. Mr Lewis hopes the sale of the fleet will draw a line under a difficult year in which Tesco lurched from crisis to crisis, including a fraud investigation into after a £263million black hole emerged in its accounts. The supermarket haemorrhaged senior staff losing its chairman, chief executive and finance director while being hit hard by competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen customers. In September Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever. However less than four weeks after informing the City he no longer wanted to maintain the fleet, Lewis could not resist hopping onto a private jet to visit seven locations in Asia in four days. A spokesman said: ‘In October we said we would dispose of the five aircraft we operated. The last aircraft will be handed back by the end of May at the latest. Tesco spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world between 2005 and 2012 . ‘The aircraft have not been used by Tesco since December. In future we will use chartered aircraft only if there is a compelling business justification and travel cannot be completed by scheduled airline.’ Between 2005 and 2012 the firm has spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world. Previous chief executive Sir Terry Leahy has been reported as saying he preferred flights with EasyJet than flying on private jets but still managed to spend £2.3 million on the planes in 2009. The bill increased dramatically under the management of former boss Phil Clarke. In February 2011 under the tenure of Clarke it had jumped to £8.9 million. A brand new Gulfstream was delivered and sold almost immediately in November along with a Cessna Citation and another Hawker.\n","**Gold label summary**: Tesco operated multimillion-pound a fleet of five aircraft for its bosses .

The 26-year-old maths teacher, her rescue volunteer brother Andreas and their parents told friends they do not plan to return to their home in the centre of the close-knit rural community of Montabaur. Scroll down for video . Kathrin Goldbach, the girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz, and her family, including her brother Andreas (pictured left and right), have reportedly fled their home in Montabaur and have no plans to return . A friend of the distraught family said: ‘The girlfriend of the co-pilot has nothing to do with what happened. ‘But the hatred of the world is coming down upon her, and you know this place is so small, it is very hard for them to come back here. ‘They would have to look to find somewhere to stay around here if they wanted to get away. It is just not possible for them to keep a low profile so they are not coming back. ‘It is so much easier if you live in Dusseldorf or somewhere like that. ‘But for the parents to come back here, it was almost impossible for them, it is just too small a town.’ An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death.

An extremely shaken Miss Goldbach, who is seeking comfort from a priest, told investigators that her long-term boyfriend Lubtiz had whisked her away on holiday just days before his death . Family members were also said to have joined the couple – who first met while working in a local Burger King as teenagers - on the final holiday. Miss Goldbach left her teaching job in Montabaur after Lubitz qualified as a pilot in 2013 and the pair moved to a flat in Dusseldorf. She got a job in a secondary school in a town called Krefeld just outside of the city.

He showed no signs of suicidal thoughts.’ Yesterday French prosecutor Brice Robin called for anyone with footage of the plane crash which killed 150 people to hand it over to the authorities.

Tragic: Iain Mackay's Thai girlfriend Nilobon Patty, known as Patty Patrick, has denied any involvement in the death of the 40-year-old Scot . According to Ms Patty, the couple had been seeing each other for three years, but that Mr Mackay ended their relationship last month as his work overseas prevented him from settling down with her. She claims she was not with another man, but out with friends, when an 'obviously drunk' Mr Mackay appeared in the bar around 1am. Tragic: Mr Mackay, 40, allegedly got into a fight after discovering Ms Patty talking to another man . Ms Patty claims Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, shouted at her, accused her of laughing at him, after which she decided to go home. Police informed her of Mr Mackay's incident in her place of work the next day, she told The Daily Record. 'I was told that Iain had gone there at 3am looking for me and I wasn't there,' she told the paper. 'People have been phoning me and making threats and saying I should leave Hua Hin. But I have done nothing wrong,' 'I don't know why anyone would say that I had anything to do with Iain's death. That is not true. It was just a terrible accident.' Thai police said Mr Mackay was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a pool bar near to the venue where he had spotted Ms Patty and the mystery man. Friends of Mr Mackay say that had posted links to his Ms Patty's Facebook page on the evening of his incident which showed her pictured with another man. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the pool shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed.

Now new research revealed that male and female stegosaurus had different shaped plates running along their backs. It raises the prospect that the dinosaurs used its giant bony protrusions, which could reach up to 2.5 feet, to attract a mate. Scientists have found that male stegosaurus (top) had different shaped armoured plates to females (bottom) Palaeontologists say male stegosaurus could have used them to show off their prowess in much the same way as peacocks do today. The research has also helped to answer a problem that has baffled palaeontologists for decades. A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock in the mid-90s, but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the 'lovers'. Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. Some stegosaurus individuals have been found with wide plates while others had tall plates with a sharper tip that were 45 per cent smaller. Experts believed that these may have been two distinct species or individuals of a different age. However, using modern scanning techniques on a group of stegosaurus discovered at a 'graveyard' in central Montana, scientists have unraveled the answer. They found dinosaurs that had both sets of plates in the graveyard, suggesting they lived side-by-side. Apart from the different plates, their skeletons were identical. This makes it unlikely that they were different species and CT scanning has shown that the bones were not morphing into one or the other. This suggests they belonged to two different sexes instead. The research team believe that the males may have had the larger, broader plates for use in mating displays while the females had the sharper taller plates, that may have helped to discourage unwanted attention or predators. Evan Saitta, who conducted the work at the University of Bristol, said: 'As males typically invest more in their ornamentation, the larger, wide plates likely came from males. 'These broad plates would have provided a great display surface to attract mates. 'The tall plates might have functioned as prickly predator deterrents in females.' Stegosaurus, a herbivorous dinosaur, lived around 150 million years ago during the late Jurassic period in the western United States. Along with its bony back, it also had large spikes on its tail that are thought to have been for defence or fights with rivals. Stegosaurus (above) lived around 150 million years ago but scientists have been baffled by differences between the shape of the plates on some fossils - leading some to believe they were different species . The new research on the armoured plates  may help scientists determine whether 'Sophie', the stegosaurus at the Natural History Museum in London pictured above, really is a female or if it was in fact a male dinosaur . Some dinosaur experts have speculated that the bony plates may have been covered in skin filled with blood vessels so they could flush with colour. This could have acted as a warning to predator or being used as a way of attracting attention of the opposite sex. Most dinosaur remains are difficult to determine the sex but there are a few that have been found to exhibit differences between males and females. Some had large crests or nose horns that may have been sexual features. Professor Paul Barrett, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London where one of the most complete stegosaur skeletons has just gone on display, said: 'It is interesting because it would add to the debate on what the plates were for. 'Sexual dimorphism is something we see a lot in modern animals, although it's not particularly prevalent in living reptiles or in living birds.' However he added: 'I'd like to see a lot more information on the graveyard site itself, the different sizes of the specimens, how they were arranged in the ground, more detail on the geology, and on the analyses that were done.'

Aluel Manyang was moved from the intensive care unit at the Royal Children's about 5.15pm on Friday, and greeted her distraught mother, Akon Goode, with a 'big hug', her father said. 'She didn't believe that her mum was still alive,' Joseph Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for videos . Aueel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . Ms Guode visited her daughter for the first time but did not stay the night in the hospital. Mr Manyang said his daughter was expected to make a '100 per cent' recovery and she should be allowed to go home within four days. The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Aluel Manyang believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings - one-year-old brother Bol and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday. The crash on Wednesday killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang, says five-year-old Awel remains in a serious condition at the Royal Children's Hospital but she remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said. 'I went to see her yesterday and she was happy to see me. She knew me when I asked: 'Do you know me?' She said, 'Yeah, you're Daddy'.' Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody on Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told him she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west just before 4pm on Wednesday . Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun. 'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said.

'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He told CNN: 'Unfortunately, we have a number of eyewitness accounts that point to the strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the rail.' According to witnesses the mother was holding him and another child when he fell. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.'

The country's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside. Scroll down for video . Dame Sally Davies, the country's chief medical officer, who has ordered a cost review into giving all under-fours free vitamin D supplements . Now, it has been reported that Professor Davies has ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) to review the cost of providing vitamin supplements to all children under the age of four, in a bid to reverse the trend. The move is being supported by one of Britain's leading experts on vitamin D deficiency at University College Hospital London Alastair Sutcliffe, who has spoken about an 'epidemic' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen. He told the Sunday Times: 'Nothing is free but the cost of the ill-effects of deficiency, such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the NHS. 'Sunblock is so powerful it does work but you end up with no exposure to the sun. 'The outcome is that you are blocking out sunshine and you have a secondary effect of reduced exposure to sunshine which the human race needs.' Rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs, pictured, and a curvature of the spine . Rickets, which is also known as soft bones, can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine. During the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil, but this practice stopped in the 1950s. An estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin D levels below the recommended amount. Figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition  in the financial year 2012-13. Professor Davies has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children. A scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of Birmingham handing out supplements, which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems. She said: 'We are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take-up is low, but many children not in these communities need them too.' The NHS already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins, but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the NHS’s means-tested Healthy Start scheme. Professor Davies said the UK’s record on children’s health used to be ‘one of the best but we are now the worst’. Possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking, and poor care in infancy. Rickets, or soft and deformed bones, was first noted by physicians in ancient Rome but was not linked with lack of vitamin D until the start of the 20th century. It was common in Victorian times because of lack of access to sunlight – which the body needs to make vitamin D – and poor diets. It mostly disappeared in the West during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine, and children were also routinely given cod liver oil. Rickets is still a major problem in third-world countries. However, UK cases have been rising in the past 15 years, from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011. Experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past. They also blame extensive use of sunscreen, and children spending more time indoors.\n"," The new minister has been used to be a new new new new new new new new new new - year . <unk> The new new new new new new new day . <unk> The new - year - year - year - year - year - year -\n","\n","This is the shocking moment a toddler was left hanging by her neck as she tried to climb out of her cot - and was only saved because her mother was watching her on the baby monitor. Ophelia Conant had managed to crawl backwards through a gap in the cot at her home in Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire, but was left hanging mid air by her neck. The furniture boss who supplied the beds, Phillip Dickens, who was described as the 'king of DIY' was today fined £50,000 and given a suspended prison sentence. Ophelia Conant managed to crawl backwards out of her cot and get trapped between the horizontal handrail . The 19-month-old was left dangling mid air by her neck and was only saved because her mother had been watching her on the baby monitor . The 19-month-old was only saved when her mother, Louise Conant, happened to be watching the incident unfold on a baby monitor. Days later a second toddler was found dangling from the £450 bed with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. Both mothers had purchased the Nutkin three-drawer cotbeds from Dicken's company, Baumhaus Ltd, which had the beds produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. Amersham Crown Court heard Mrs Conant had put Ophelia in the cotbed for her lunchtime sleep on April 16, 2013, when she saw her getting into difficulty via the video monitoring system. She rushed upstairs to find her daughter hanging by her neck, which had become lodged in a gap between the end of the bed and a horizontal handrail. Judge Karen Holt told Dickens: 'Seeing her daughter on the baby video monitor screen hanging by her neck was, using her words, beyond description and completely traumatic to her. 'One can only imagine the horror that mother must have felt. In her view, it is without doubt the fact she had a video monitor that saved her daughter's life.' She added: 'This is a serious offence because it came through your negligence. It could have caused the loss of life of babies. 'The crown's case against the company and you was, with your negligence, this unsafe product was put on the market. 'Clearly, you did not act with all due diligence, or take all reasonable precautions to make sure such a situation would not occur. 'The product itself was dealing with the most vulnerable people in society, and I know that you accept that.' Louise Conant with her daughter Ophelia today after what she described as a 'traumatic' experience . Judge Holt said the design of the cot 'could have been fatal' and added that although Dickens and the company had been 'naive and negligent', there was 'very strong mitigation' on their behalf. Nine days after Ophelia's incident, Deborah Turner, from Northamptonshire found her son dangling on the outside of the cot with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail. 'It took both her and her mother to lift her son back through the gap,' said Judge Holt. Mrs Conant complained to Trading Standards at Buckinghamshire County Council and officers took away the cotbed before confronting Baumhaus. They were shown a copy of the video of Ophelia and immediately recalled all the cots it had sent out around the country. The court was told no health and safety tests were carried out in the UK, with the only quality control being made in the Chinese factory, which did not comply with British safety standards. Following test reports and an offer from Dickens to give Mrs Conant a part-refund, Baumhaus was served a product recall notice in July 2013, which recovered 93 per cent of the 212 cotbeds sold. The following month Trading Standards received three lab test reports which identified failures, including test parameters and clauses relating to strength of certain parts, finger, head and neck entrapment, and BSI standards markings. Thames Valley Police visited Baumhaus in October and seized computer equipment. A month later Dickens was interviewed under caution during which he confirmed the company had designed the Nutkin cotbed, which was produced in China and imported back into Britain for distribution. The court heard the prototype had been tested and passed in 2010 but the product placed on the market in 2013 had different dimensions and Dickens had no proper quality control in this country. In mitigation Sunyana Sharma told the court neither Dickens nor Baumhaus set out to harm children with their cotbed, and the company accepted that it failed in not having proper quality control. She added that the company had acted quickly to remove the product from distribution and done all it could to trace the remaining cots, all of which were accepted by Judge Holt. Phillip Dickens, company director of furniture supplier Baumhaus Ltd, which distributed the beds, was today given a suspended prison sentence for placing an unsafe product on the market . Judge Holt described this as a serious offence but said the court acknowledged naivety and negligence on the part of the defendant, who at the time had no manufacturing experience, kept no technical product notes, and relied on an external company for testing to assess compliance with relevant British Standards. Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, entered pleas on the company's behalf at an earlier hearing, admitting two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013. The 38-year-old, of Burnley, Lancashire, was given a three month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. He also pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to his company, which is based near Bicester, Oxfordshire, and ordered to pay £500 to the two mothers. Baumhaus was given a £12,000 fine and Dickens and his company also face prosecution costs of £35,653. Judge Holt said she felt able to suspend the jail sentence because of his lack of intent to cause injury in supplying the potentially deadly cots to the market. She added: 'It is very difficult to put a figure on the clear distress that both these ladies suffered.' In a statement read through solicitor Tim Healy, Dickens and Baumhaus said they 'sincerely regretted' any distress caused to the families. Speaking outside court Dickens' solicitor, Mr Healy, said: 'Baumhaus Limited and Philip Dickens wish to express their sincere regret for any distress caused to the families effected. 'Health and safety remains of paramount concern to Mr Dickens and the company.' Speaking after the hearing Mrs Conant said the court case brought an element of closure to the nightmare experience of seeing her daughter trapped by her neck in her cot. She said: 'I bought what I thought was the best for Ophelia - a premium quality cot bed. But it turned out to be a living hell. Standards Officers Rebecca Kaya (right) and Kirit Vadia (left) examine the Nutkin three-drawer cotbed . 'For a long time afterwards it gave me nightmares, and it made me nervous about putting Ophelia to bed. 'The video monitor definitely saved her life. I'd never have thought to buy one, but a friend suggested it. Now I'd urge every parent to consider a video monitor for their child.' Trading Standards Officer Rebecca Kaya, who led the investigation, said the case demonstrated the department's commitment to protecting families from products posing a safety risk, and was an example of the tough measures they were prepared to take. She said: 'This case highlights the need to be very careful buying online. Before clicking the \"buy\" button, make sure you have a manufacturer's code, product code and full contact details of the retailer, including a cancellation process in case you need to return the product, or there is a safety problem.' Ms Kaya added that they believe there are still 12 cotbeds out there that weren't reached during the product recall.\n"," The woman was found in the woman in the child . <unk> She was found in the family of her mother , but was a ' <unk> She was a ' <unk> She was a ' <unk> She was a ' \n","\n","Model Karlie Kloss is spreading her passion for computer coding and empowering young women by teaming up with the Flatiron School in New York to offer teen girls around the country scholarships to the academy's software engineering program this summer.

Role model: Karlie Kloss can be seen flexing her muscles in a promotional video for her Kode With Karlie scholarship program, which will provide 20 young girls free tuition for a computer coding course this summer . Team player: The 22-year-old model was filmed working with other students at the Flatiron School in New York, where her scholarship recipients will be taking a two week software engineering program . Karlie is donating $20,000 of her own money for the classes, which cost $2,000 per student, while the Flatiron school has offered to match her contribution. The blonde beauty, who describes herself as a 'model, ballerina and cookie expert' in the clip, explains that she learned how 'creative coding truly is' when she studied it last summer. 'Similar to dance and fashion, coding is a form of self-expression,' she says. 'It's a way to turn a cool, innovative idea into a product, website, app, tool or experience.' Karlie says it was this revelation that inspired her to share her passion with other girls across the country. Major revelation: Karlie attended the coding course, which costs $2,000 per student, last year . Deep in thought: The former Victoria's Secret Angel can be seen working on a computer programming project with other students . Completed project: Karlie and other students watched their hard work pay off as their creation took flight . After the course, her 20 scholarship recipients will understand the 'building blocks of coding' and have already built and deployed their own app to the web. In order to apply for the scholarship, female students are asked to film a 60 second video explaining how they plan to use their 'coding super powers' after they complete the course. Karlie took to social media yesterday to promote the opportunity, tweeting: 'Who runs the world? CODERS! Apply for the #KodeWithKarlie Scholarship @FlatironSchool for your chance to learn code! [sic]' And it's clear that Karlie, who also co-founded Karlie’s Kookies with chef and owner of Milk Bar Christina Tosi, takes her entrepreneurial roles and studies seriously. Stellar student: Karlie can be seen working with other students at the software engineering class last summer . Combined interests: The blonde beauty can be seen speaking on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas . In February, it was announced that she was hanging up her Angel wings and leaving Victoria's Secret to focus on other business opportunities, as well as her classes at New York University. The model will be starting college at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study in the fall, where she will study computer coding. Karlie, who covered the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine that she 'definitely could not get a job as a coder yet'. American girl: Karlie, who covers the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine she is 'fascinated' by computer coding . Catwalk queen: Karlie can be seen strutting down the runway at the Tom Ford show (L) and the Atelier Versace haute couture show (R) earlier this year . 'But it is something I am fascinated by, even if it is not the profession I choose,' she added. Karlie continued: 'Simply having the comprehension of the way that it works, having the ability to speak that language and to be able to not only comprehend it, but write and build something – the world is built on code.' And Karlie has no problem blending her two worlds together. Last month, she spoke on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas.\n"," The former Cameron has been charged with a new new new new own . <unk> The former ' and has been used to be a ' <unk> The new ' <unk> The pair have been used to be a ' \n","\n","The family of a former art teacher who died from lung cancer after years of pinning pupils' work to classroom walls lined with asbestos has taken legal action against the local council. Jennifer Barnett worked Archway School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, between 1980 and 1997, when she left teaching to have her fourth child. The 60-year-old died last September, 14 months after she was diagnosed with mesothelioma - a cancer whose most common cause is asbestos. Loved: Jennifer Barnett worked Archway School in Stroud, Gloucestershire, between 1980 and 1997, when she left teaching to have her fourth child. Above, the mother-of-four with her husband and children . Her husband, Nigel, told an inquest into her death in January that his wife had to cut sheets of asbestos while working on a farm in her 20s. 'She then became an art teacher and from 1977 until 1995 worked at various schools, often hanging paintings on walls containing asbestos,' he added. The coroner, Katy Skerrett, recorded a verdict of death as a result of industrial disease. A post-mortem found a large tumour in her right lung. Ms Skerrett said: 'It is clear that there was sufficient exposure to asbestos in her occupation for me to reach a conclusion that this lady died from an industrial disease.' Mr Barnett and his family believe the asbestos in the school is to blame for Mrs Barnett's death and are now taking legal action against Gloucestershire County Council. In a statement released this week, Mr Barnett said that during her time as a teacher, his wife also did clay modelling with pupils and the cupboard where the clay was stored also contained asbestos. He said: 'Jen was a fantastic wife and a wonderful mother to our four children. She was so precious to us and it is hard to believe she's gone. 'Prior to her illness, she was a very fit and healthy 60-year old who enjoyed playing tennis in her spare time and was a dedicated and extremely talented artist who continued to work right up until her death. 'Our youngest daughter was only 18 when her mum passed away and was just about to start university. 'The whole family misses her dreadfully and we are all shocked and devastated that her life was cut short so suddenly.' Mrs Barnett worked at Archway School, where she was known as Miss Shonk, as an art teacher before being promoted head of the department. She left teaching aged 42 to have her youngest daughter, but continued to work as an artist. Her family said she remained positive during 'gruelling' chemotherapy treatment, but died the day after celebrating her 30th wedding anniversary, in September 2014. Dedicated: For 17 years, Mrs Barnett worked at Archway School, in Stroud, Gloucestershire, pictured, where she was known as Miss Shonk, as an art teacher before being promoted head of the department . Mr Barnett said: 'I'll never forget the consultant at the hospital asking Jen if she'd ever been exposed to asbestos and her saying a definite \"yes\" because she knew a lot of asbestos was previously used in school buildings. 'Jen fought the cancer bravely and remained positive throughout gruelling sessions of chemotherapy. 'The day before she died, she even managed to come to the little village church where we were married to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we had a very special day together as a family. 'Photographs taken that day show her smiling and we will always treasure them.' Mr Barnett, from Painswick, Gloucestershire, has instructed specialist asbestos disease lawyers at Novum Law to investigate his wife's working conditions at the school. He added: 'I am hoping former teachers or ex-pupils will come forward who may have some knowledge about the asbestos ceiling tiles at Archway School or know of any other asbestos products or materials that were used there.' Helen Grady, an asbestos disease solicitor at Novum Law said: 'It is alarming that we are seeing more and more cases involving teachers. 'Asbestos was widely used in the UK as a building material for fireproofing and insulation from the 1950s up until 1985, when most types were banned. 'It was banned completely from new buildings in 1999 but, sadly the damage had already been done for thousands of victims who have paid the ultimate price for going to work every day. 'We hope anyone who may have attended Archway or worked there remembers Jen and can shed more light on how she got exposed.' Archway headteacher Colin Belford said staff were saddened by their former colleague's death, and were not aware of the issues raised by the coroner. He said: 'Staff who worked with her at Archway spoke of her with great affection and admiration. 'I can say that all of the building work which has taken place at Archway in recent years is fully compliant with modern building regulations. 'I am not aware of any current risk to staff or students but will ask the local authority for its assurance on this matter.' Phil Ashbee-Dobbins, Gloucestershire County Council asbestos administration officer, said: 'Buildings built in the 1960s and 1970s, and even up until the late 90s often have asbestos in them. 'It doesn't pose a risk unless it is disturbed, and we help schools under local authority control keep their own accurate records and to make sure it is treated properly and safely. 'Archway School has been extensively renovated in recent years. In addition, regular asbestos audits are completed as part of standard health and safety procedures. 'While we are unable to comment on this specific case, we would like to reassure parents, pupils and teachers that current guidance and practices in our county's schools appropriately manage the risks associated with asbestos.'\n"," The woman was found in a ' and her mother , and her mother . <unk> She was a ' and her mother and her mother , but he was a ' <unk> She was a ' <unk> She was found in the child . \n","\n","Bradley Dew has been jailed for mugging his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £10 note . A thug has been jailed after he mugged his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £10 note. Bradley Dew, 26, had been drinking with his friend at a pub in Faversham in Kent earlier that day and had borrowed his mobile. But later in the evening Dew returned to his friend's home, claiming he had lost the mobile on a train after returning from Herne Bay. As the friend said he was about to go out with his girlfriend, Dew pushed him back into a wall before striking him across the face. He then stole £10 out of his wallet. Dew, of Faversham, then fled the scene, and was found by police hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend's home hours later on March 29 last year. Officers said he was likely to have been left feeling vulnerable after being mugged in his own home. Dew denied stealing from his friend, and told officers it would have been 'like robbing my brother.' However he was found guilty of robbery and assault, following a trial held at Maidstone Crown Court. Detective Constable Kathryn Lumsden-Earle, of Kent Police, said: 'Dew took advantage of a so-called friend's generosity, taking his phone and then never returning it. 'He then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet. 'He did all of this in the victim's own home, which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety. 'Time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day, but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend.' Dew, 26, was found guilty of robbery and assault by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured)\n"," The man was found in his wife and was arrested in his wife . <unk> He was found in his wife and was ' <unk> He was ' <unk> He was ' <unk> He was ' <unk> He was ' <unk> He was ' <unk> He was ' <unk>\n","\n","Victor Moses has returned to Chelsea after being ruled out for the season.

Victor Moses has returned to parent club Chelsea for treatment after injuring a hamstring against West Ham . Stoke are still interested in tying up a permanent move for the Nigeria international after a successful loan . Meanwhile, the Potters have opened talks with Ligue 1 side Evian over the possible transfer of defender Daniel Wass - who has been watched by Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle over the past year. The 25-year-old Denmark international is available for around £3.5million and is keen to try his luck in the Premier League, despite interest from the likes of Inter Milan and Schalke. Hughes has been given licence to spend this summer with players including Moses, Manchester United forward Javier Hernandez and Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole on his wishlist.

The Welshman has received some criticism from sections of the Bernabeu support despite a bright start in Madrid, and these remarkable stats will do nothing to help his popularity at the club. The £86million man has missed out on just eight starts in Real Madrid's 50 matches this term, but his team-mates have picked up a 100 per cent win record when he has been away, scoring 25 and conceding just one goal. Gareth Bale has not started eight of Real Madrid's matches this season, through injury and omission . His latest injury, suffered against Malaga, meant he missed Wednesday night's Champions League game . Bale's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against Barcelona, two Champions League ties with Liverpool (in which he entered the fray as a 62nd-minute substitute at the Bernabeu), and Wednesday night's European quarter-final against Atletico... but it seems the rest of the Real squad are just fine without him. In the first half of the season, Bale suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with Wales, and he missed La Liga matches against Levante (5-0 win), Barcelona (3-1 win), Granada (4-0 win) and a 3-0 Champions League victory against Liverpool. He was in contention for the return leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu, but did not start the match, instead coming on as a second-half substitute. Real were 1-0 up when he came on, and the score remained the same until the final whistle. In December, Madrid were already leading 4-1 against third-tier side Cornella in their Copa del Rey tie heading into the second leg, and Carlo Ancelotti opted to rest some of his biggest names. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Bale were all among the stars watching on from the sidelines as Los Blancos recorded a comfortable 5-0 win. That's six games without Bale in the starting line-up, and six wins for Real. Moving into 2015, Bale played a major role in the team's start to the year, scoring 12 goals between his return to the side against Celta Vigo and his omission against Eibar on April 11. Bale was sidelined for Real's 3-1 win over Barcelona, in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty . Karim Benzema scored in a 3-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield in October... Bale was injured for the game . Ancelotti stated in the build-up to the match that he had decided to rest the Welshman, while the team went on to win 3-0 against their struggling opposition. Bale again returned the side for two matches, a goalless draw against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and a win against Malaga in La Liga, but suffered a calf injury in the early stages of the latter domestic clash. Instead of taking to the field in the crucial European match on Wednesday night, Bale was resigned to watching the match from home, where he tweeted his support of the team. Javier Hernandez's goal against Atletico ensured Real have won all of their eight matches without Bale . The Welshman took to Facebook on Wednesday to wish Real Madrid good luck against city rivals Atletico . Javier Hernandez's late goal ensured another victory for Ancelotti's men, taking their Bale-less record to eight wins, no draws and no losses. With the Welshman, Real have a 69 per cent win record, far from disastrous, recording 29 wins, four draws and nine losses. But the stats without him will surely give ammunition to those unhappy with their £86million man.\n"," Liverpool 's first - 0 - 0 in the Premier League . <unk> The Premier League striker 's side 's side at the Premier League . <unk> The Premier League striker 's side of his side . \n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Misc Testing"],"metadata":{"id":"7xtDW2OhgClw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"E27z4QMLv__o"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
